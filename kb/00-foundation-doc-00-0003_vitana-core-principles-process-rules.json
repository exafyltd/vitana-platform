Does it have a VTID?\"\n- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** Must reference and comply with relevant principles\n- **Incident reviews:** \"Which principle was violated, and how do we prevent recurrence?\"\n- **Roadmap prioritization:** Features that strengthen core principles take precedence\n\n**Precedence:** When this document conflicts with other documentation, DOC-00-0003 takes precedence unless explicitly overridden through the ADR process (Section 8).\n\n---",

Does this decision prioritize member health and well-being? (Principle: Health-First)\n2. Is it logged in OASIS for transparency? (Principle: If It's Not in OASIS, It Didn't Happen)\n3.
