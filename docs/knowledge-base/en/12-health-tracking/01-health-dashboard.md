# Your Health Dashboard

Your Health Dashboard is where everything comes together. It is the single screen where I show you the full picture of your vitality -- all five health pillars, your Vitana Index score, your recent trends, and the actions that will make the biggest difference today. Think of it as your daily health briefing, designed to give you clarity without overwhelming you with numbers.

Let me walk you through what you will find here and how to make the most of it.

## Your Vitana Index at a Glance

At the top of the dashboard, you will see your Vitana Index score. This is the number that reflects your overall vitality across all five pillars -- Nutrition, Hydration, Exercise, Sleep, and Mental Wellness. It updates as you log new data, so the score you see is always current.

Below your main score, you will see the individual pillar sub-scores. Each one tells you how you are doing in that specific area. If your overall Index is strong but one pillar is lagging, I highlight it so you know exactly where to focus. I want you to see not just the number, but the story behind it -- which areas are carrying you forward and which ones need a little more attention.

Trend arrows next to each score show whether you are moving up, holding steady, or dipping compared to recent days. These small signals matter. A single off day is not a concern, but a trend over several days is something worth noticing. I help you see those patterns early, before they become problems.

## Quick Actions -- Log in Seconds

The dashboard is built for speed. Right from the main view, you have quick-action buttons that let you log health data in just a tap or two:

**Log a Meal.** Tap to quickly record what you ate. You can do a simple entry -- just the meal name and a general sense of what it included -- or go deeper with specific foods and portions. Either way, it takes seconds and feeds your Nutrition pillar.

**Record Water.** A single tap adds a glass of water to your daily total. If you drank a bottle or a specific amount, you can adjust. Your Hydration pillar updates immediately.

**Add Exercise.** Log a workout, a walk, a yoga session, or any physical activity. Quick presets let you choose common activities, or you can describe what you did in your own words.

**Rate Your Sleep.** Each morning, take a moment to tell me how you slept. A simple quality rating plus your bedtime and wake time gives me what I need to track your Sleep pillar. If you have a wearable device connected, this data flows in automatically.

**Check In on Mood.** A quick emotional check-in helps me understand where you are mentally. Just a few taps to rate how you are feeling. Over time, these check-ins reveal patterns you might not notice on your own.

You do not need to use every quick action every day. Even logging one or two things consistently gives me enough data to provide meaningful guidance. The more you share, the sharper my recommendations become -- but I never want tracking to feel like a chore.

## Dashboard Widgets

Below the quick actions, your dashboard displays a set of widgets that give you a snapshot of your day and your recent progress.

**Daily Progress.** A visual summary of how much you have logged today across each pillar. You can see at a glance whether you have eaten, hydrated, moved, and checked in. It is not about perfection -- it is about awareness.

**Active Goals.** If you have set health goals or are following a health plan, your active goals appear here with progress indicators. You can see how close you are to your targets and what steps remain for the day.

**Recent Trends.** A compact view of your pillar scores over the past week or two. This is where patterns emerge. Maybe your sleep has been steadily improving since you started your evening routine, or your hydration dips every weekend. I surface these trends so you can act on them.

**Autopilot Insights.** The Autopilot system is always working in the background, analyzing your data and looking for opportunities to help. When it has something worth sharing -- a suggestion, a nudge, a connection it has noticed between your habits -- it appears here. These insights are personalized to you and timed to be relevant right now.

## Customizing Your View

Everyone's health priorities are different, and your dashboard should reflect what matters most to you. You can customize which widgets appear and how they are arranged.

If you are focused on improving your sleep, you might want the sleep trend widget front and center. If you are training for a fitness goal, the exercise tracker might take priority. You can rearrange widgets by pressing and holding, then dragging them into the order that works for you.

You can also choose which quick actions appear in the primary row. If you never manually log sleep because your wearable handles it, you can swap that button for something you use more often.

The goal is to make the dashboard feel like it was built just for you -- because, in a very real sense, it was.

## The Dashboard and the Autopilot

Your Health Dashboard is not just a display. It is directly connected to the Autopilot system that powers my real-time guidance. Every piece of data that flows through the dashboard -- every meal logged, every sleep rating, every mood check-in -- feeds the Autopilot's understanding of where you are and what you need.

When I notice that you have not logged water today and it is already afternoon, I might gently remind you. When your exercise consistency drops for a few days, I might ask how you are feeling and whether something is getting in the way. When your mood check-ins show a dip alongside poor sleep, I connect the dots and suggest addressing sleep first.

This is not random. It is intelligence built on your data, your patterns, and your goals. The dashboard is where you see the inputs. The Autopilot is where those inputs become personalized action.

## Starting Your Day with the Dashboard

I recommend making the Health Dashboard part of your morning routine. Take thirty seconds when you wake up to rate your sleep, log your first glass of water, and glance at any Autopilot insights waiting for you. That small habit gives me fresh data to work with and gives you a clear sense of where your day starts.

Throughout the day, the dashboard is always just a tap away. Log as you go -- a meal after you eat, water as you drink, exercise when you finish. The more current your data is, the more useful my guidance becomes.

At the end of the day, a quick look at your daily progress can be its own reward. Seeing those pillars filled in, even partially, is a reminder that you are investing in your future self.

## Everything Connects

Your Health Dashboard is not an isolated feature. It is the hub that connects to every other part of your health tracking experience -- your nutrition logs, your hydration tracking, your exercise records, your sleep data, your mental wellness check-ins, your biomarker history, and your wearable device data. Everything flows through here, and everything I learn from this data flows back to you as smarter, more personal guidance.

This is your command center for longevity. And I am here to help you use it every single day.
