# Connecting Wearable Devices

Your wearable device knows things about your body that you might not notice on your own -- how your heart rate changes throughout the day, how deeply you sleep, how much you actually move, how your nervous system recovers from stress. When you connect your wearable to Vitanaland, all of that data flows into your health profile automatically, giving me a richer, more accurate picture of your vitality. The result is a Vitana Index that reflects not just what you tell me, but what your body is actually doing.

## Supported Devices

I work with the most popular wearable devices and health platforms. Here are the devices you can connect:

**Apple Watch.** If you use an Apple Watch, your health data syncs through Apple Health. This includes heart rate, HRV, sleep stages, workouts, steps, active calories, and more. The Apple Watch is one of the most comprehensive data sources available, and connecting it significantly enriches your health profile.

**Fitbit.** Fitbit devices provide excellent sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, step counting, and activity logging. Whether you wear a Fitbit smartwatch or a simple fitness band, the data it collects adds meaningful depth to your tracking.

**Oura Ring.** The Oura Ring specializes in sleep and recovery data -- sleep stages, HRV, body temperature trends, resting heart rate, and readiness scores. If you wear an Oura Ring, the sleep and recovery data it provides is among the best available from any consumer device.

**Garmin.** Garmin devices are popular with athletes and active individuals. They provide detailed workout data, GPS tracking, heart rate, VO2 max estimates, sleep tracking, and more. If you use a Garmin watch, connecting it brings rich exercise and performance data into your profile.

**Other Devices.** I continue to expand the range of supported devices and health platforms. If you use a different wearable or health app, check the connections settings to see the current list of supported integrations. New devices are added regularly.

## What Data Syncs

When you connect a wearable, the following types of data can flow into your Vitanaland profile, depending on what your device measures:

**Heart Rate.** Your resting heart rate and heart rate throughout the day. This helps me understand your cardiovascular health and recovery state. Sustained elevation in resting heart rate can signal stress, illness, or overtraining.

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV).** The variation in time between heartbeats -- one of the most powerful biomarkers for longevity. Higher HRV generally indicates a well-recovered, resilient nervous system. I track your HRV trends to guide recommendations about training intensity, rest, and stress management.

**Sleep Stages.** Deep sleep, light sleep, and REM sleep duration. Understanding how much time you spend in each stage helps me assess the quality of your recovery and identify opportunities to improve your rest.

**Steps.** Your daily step count is a simple but meaningful indicator of overall movement. I track your steps and use them alongside your exercise logs to build a complete picture of your daily activity level.

**Active Minutes and Workouts.** When your wearable detects a workout or sustained activity, that data syncs automatically. This means your exercise tracking stays complete even when you forget to log manually.

**Calories Burned.** Estimated energy expenditure helps me understand your metabolic output and ensure your nutrition is aligned with your activity level.

## How to Connect Your Device

Connecting your wearable is straightforward:

1. Open your profile settings in Vitanaland.
2. Navigate to the Connections or Devices section.
3. Select your device or health platform from the list.
4. Follow the authorization steps to grant Vitanaland permission to read your health data.
5. Once connected, your historical data begins syncing, and new data flows in automatically going forward.

The authorization process is handled securely through your device's official health platform -- Apple Health, Fitbit's platform, Oura's platform, or Garmin Connect. You are granting read access only. Vitanaland reads your health data but never writes to or modifies your device's records.

If you need help connecting your device, just ask me. I can walk you through the process step by step, specific to the device you use.

## Troubleshooting Sync Issues

Occasionally, data syncing may pause or fall behind. Here are the most common causes and solutions:

**Authorization Expired.** Some platforms require you to periodically re-authorize the connection. If your data stops syncing, check your connection settings and re-authorize if prompted.

**Device Not Syncing to Its App.** Your wearable first syncs data to its own app (Apple Health, Fitbit app, Oura app, Garmin Connect), and then Vitanaland reads from that app. If your device is not syncing to its own app -- perhaps due to Bluetooth being off or the app not being opened recently -- the data will not reach Vitanaland. Make sure your device is syncing to its native app normally.

**Background Refresh Disabled.** On some phones, background app refresh must be enabled for health data to sync continuously. Check your phone's settings to make sure the relevant health apps are allowed to refresh in the background.

**Delayed Data.** Some data types, particularly sleep data, may take a few hours after you wake up to fully process and sync. If you do not see last night's sleep data immediately in the morning, it may simply need more time.

If you have tried these steps and your data still is not syncing, let me know and I will help you diagnose the issue further.

## Why Wearable Data Makes Your Vitana Index More Accurate

Your Vitana Index is built from the data available to me. When you rely entirely on manual logging, I work with what you report -- and that is valuable. But manual logging has natural gaps. You might forget to log a walk, underestimate your sleep disruptions, or not realize that your resting heart rate has been gradually climbing.

Wearable data fills those gaps. It runs continuously, capturing data points you would never think to log manually. It measures things you cannot feel -- like HRV fluctuations, sleep stage transitions, and subtle heart rate changes. And it does it every day, without any effort on your part.

The result is a significantly more accurate and complete health profile. Your pillar scores reflect your actual biology, not just your memory of what happened. Your trends are based on continuous measurement, not periodic snapshots. And my recommendations become sharper because they are grounded in richer data.

If you do not have a wearable, your Vitana Index is still meaningful and useful based on manual tracking alone. But if you do wear one, connecting it is one of the single best things you can do to get the most out of Vitanaland.

## Privacy and Your Wearable Data

Your wearable data is personal, and I treat it with the same care and privacy as everything else in your profile. When your data syncs to Vitanaland, it is stored securely within your account and used only to serve your health and longevity goals. It is never shared with other users, sold to third parties, or used for purposes outside of your personal health guidance.

You remain in control at all times. You can disconnect your device whenever you choose, and you can review what data has been synced through your profile settings. Connecting a wearable is entirely optional -- it enhances your experience but is never required.

Your health data belongs to you. I am here to help you make the most of it.
