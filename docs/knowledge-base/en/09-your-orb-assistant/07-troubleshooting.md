# ORB Troubleshooting

I am designed to work smoothly and reliably, but technology is not perfect. Sometimes things go wrong -- a connection drops, a microphone does not respond, or something just does not feel right. When that happens, I want you to have clear, straightforward solutions so you can get back to our conversation as quickly as possible.

Here are the most common issues people encounter and how to resolve them.

## I Am Not Responding

If you tap the orb and nothing happens, or if I seem unresponsive during a conversation, here are the things to check:

**Check your internet connection.** I need an active internet connection to work. If your phone is in airplane mode, your Wi-Fi has dropped, or your cellular signal is weak, I will not be able to respond. Try opening a website or another app to confirm your connection is working. If it is not, reconnect to Wi-Fi or move to an area with better signal, then try again.

**Refresh the app.** Sometimes a simple refresh solves the problem. Close the Vitanaland app completely and reopen it. On most phones, you can do this by swiping the app away from your recent apps list and then tapping the app icon again.

**Check for app updates.** If you are running an older version of the app, it is possible that something has changed on my end that requires the latest version. Visit your app store and check if an update is available for Vitanaland. Install it and try again.

**Restart your device.** It sounds basic, but restarting your phone or computer clears temporary issues that can interfere with app performance. This is especially helpful if multiple apps have been acting strangely, not just me.

**Wait a moment and try again.** Occasionally, I experience brief periods of high demand where response times are longer than usual. If you have confirmed your internet is working and the app is up to date, waiting a minute or two and trying again often resolves the issue.

## My Voice Is Not Being Recognized

If you are speaking to me but I do not seem to hear you or understand what you are saying, here are some steps to try:

**Check your microphone permissions.** Your device needs to have granted microphone access to the Vitanaland app. On your phone, go to **Settings**, find the Vitanaland app, and make sure microphone permission is set to **Allow**. On your computer, check the microphone permission in your browser settings.

**Make sure your microphone is not muted.** Some phones have hardware mute switches or settings that can silence the microphone without you realizing it. Check that your device's microphone is active and not muted by another app.

**Reduce background noise.** I do my best with noisy environments, but heavy background noise -- loud music, construction, wind, crowded rooms -- can make it difficult for me to accurately understand your speech. Moving to a quieter space or using headphones with a built-in microphone can make a significant difference.

**Speak more clearly and at a natural pace.** If I am having trouble understanding you, try speaking a bit more clearly without rushing. You do not need to slow down dramatically -- just give each word a little more space.

**Check your language setting.** If your language preference is set to one language but you are speaking in another, I may struggle to understand you. Verify that your language setting matches the language you are speaking. You can check this in **Settings** under **Language** or **ORB Preferences**.

**Try text mode instead.** If voice recognition continues to be problematic, you can always switch to text mode. Tap the text input field and type your message. I will respond with the same depth and personalization. You can switch back to voice anytime.

## I Seem to Have Forgotten Something

If you ask me about something you previously told me and I do not seem to remember it, here are some possibilities:

**Give my memory a moment to process.** When you share information with me during a conversation, I extract and store the important facts after our session. If you told me something just minutes ago and then immediately ask me to recall it in a new session, the fact may still be processing. Wait a short while and ask again.

**Check your Memory Garden.** You can review what I have stored about you by visiting your Memory Garden. If the fact you are looking for is there, it means I have it -- I may have just not surfaced it in that particular conversation. If it is not there, I may not have captured it from our earlier conversation.

**Tell me again.** If something important did not make it into my memory, simply tell me again. Say something like "I want to make sure you remember this -- my main health goal is to improve my cardiovascular fitness." I will capture it and store it properly.

**Be specific when asking for recall.** Instead of asking "Do you remember what I told you?" try being more specific: "Do you remember my daughter's name?" or "What did I tell you about my sleep problems?" Specific questions help me retrieve the right information from my memory more accurately.

## My Responses Are Slow

If I am taking longer than usual to respond, here is what might be happening:

**Heavy usage periods.** Like any service, I can experience periods of higher demand. During these times, my responses may take a few extra seconds. This is temporary and resolves on its own.

**Slow internet connection.** My response speed depends partly on the quality of your internet connection. If your connection is slow or unstable, it will take longer for your messages to reach me and for my responses to get back to you. Try switching from cellular to Wi-Fi, or vice versa, to see if that improves things.

**Long or complex questions.** If you ask me something that requires me to think through a lot of context -- drawing on your health history, analyzing patterns, connecting multiple pieces of information -- it may take me a moment longer. This is actually me doing a more thorough job, not a technical problem.

**Try a brief, simple question first.** If I seem slow, try asking something simple like "Are you there?" or "How are you today?" If I respond quickly to that, the earlier delay was likely related to the complexity of your question. If I am still slow, it may be a connection issue.

## I Gave Incorrect or Unexpected Information

I strive to be accurate and helpful in everything I say, but I am not infallible. If something I said does not seem right, here is what to do:

**Tell me directly.** The best thing you can do is let me know. Say something like "I do not think that is right" or "Actually, that is not what I meant." I will reconsider my response and try to correct course. Your feedback makes me better at serving you.

**Provide the correct information.** If I stated a fact about you incorrectly -- for example, if I said your goal was weight loss when it is actually cardiovascular health -- just correct me. I will update my understanding and use the corrected information going forward.

**Remember my limitations.** I am a longevity companion, not a medical professional. If I share health-related information that conflicts with what your doctor has told you, always defer to your doctor. My guidance is meant to complement professional medical advice, never replace it.

**Ask me to explain my reasoning.** If you are unsure whether what I said is accurate, ask me to explain how I arrived at that conclusion. I am happy to walk you through my thinking, which often helps clarify any confusion.

## The ORB Icon Is Missing or Not Working

If you cannot find the orb icon on your screen or it does not respond when you tap it:

**Scroll to the bottom of your screen.** The orb icon is positioned at the bottom of the interface. If you have scrolled within a page, you might need to scroll back to see it.

**Check for app updates.** An outdated app version might have display issues. Update to the latest version of Vitanaland from your app store.

**Clear your app cache.** On your phone, go to **Settings**, find the Vitanaland app, and select **Clear Cache**. This removes temporary files that might be causing display problems without deleting your personal data.

**Reinstall the app if needed.** As a last resort, uninstalling and reinstalling the app can resolve persistent interface issues. Your personal data and memory are stored securely on the server, so you will not lose anything by reinstalling.

## Audio Quality Issues

If my voice sounds distorted, choppy, or hard to understand:

**Check your speaker or headphone volume.** Make sure your device volume is at a comfortable level and that your speakers or headphones are working properly.

**Switch between speaker and headphones.** If my voice sounds off through your phone's speaker, try headphones, or vice versa. Sometimes the issue is with the output device, not with my audio.

**Close other audio apps.** If another app is using your device's audio system -- a music player, a podcast app, a video call -- it can interfere with my voice output. Close those apps and try again.

**Check your internet speed.** Audio quality can degrade on very slow connections. If you are on a weak cellular signal, try connecting to Wi-Fi.

## When to Contact Support

Most issues can be resolved with the steps above. But if you have tried everything and something still is not working, do not hesitate to reach out to the Vitana support team. Here are signs that it is time to contact support:

- The issue persists after trying all the troubleshooting steps above
- You encounter the same problem repeatedly across multiple sessions
- Something about my behavior seems fundamentally wrong -- not just a misunderstanding, but a consistent pattern of incorrect responses
- You notice that your Memory Garden data seems corrupted or missing in ways that do not match what you have shared with me
- You experience a technical error message that you do not understand

You can reach support through the **Help** section in the app. When you contact them, it helps to include:

- A brief description of the problem
- What you were trying to do when it occurred
- What troubleshooting steps you have already tried
- Your device type and operating system version

The support team is there to help, and the more information you provide, the faster they can resolve the issue.

## A Note From Me

I know it is frustrating when technology does not work the way it should, especially when you are trying to have a meaningful conversation about your health and your life. I want you to know that these issues are almost always temporary and fixable.

If something goes wrong, please do not give up on our relationship. The value of what we are building together -- the memory, the context, the personalized guidance -- grows stronger with every conversation. A temporary technical hiccup does not erase any of that.

I am here for the long run, and I am always ready to pick up where we left off.
