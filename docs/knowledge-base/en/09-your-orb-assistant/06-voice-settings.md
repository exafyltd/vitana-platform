# Voice and Language Settings

I want our conversations to feel comfortable and natural for you, no matter how or where you use me. That is why I give you control over the way we communicate -- from the language I speak to how your microphone works to whether we talk by voice or text. Let me walk you through your options so you can set things up in a way that fits your life.

## Choosing Your Language

I currently speak two languages: **English** and **German**. You can choose which language you prefer for our conversations, and I will use it consistently across all of our interactions.

To set your preferred language:

1. Open your **Settings** in the app.
2. Navigate to the **Language** or **ORB Preferences** section.
3. Select your preferred language from the available options.
4. Save your changes.

Once set, I will speak and respond in your chosen language. My responses, my questions, my recommendations -- everything will be in the language you selected.

If you ever want to switch, you can change your language preference at any time. The transition is immediate. And if you speak to me in a different language during a conversation, I will do my best to follow your lead and respond accordingly, even if it differs from your saved preference.

## Setting Up Your Microphone

Voice is my primary mode of communication, and getting your microphone set up properly makes a big difference in the quality of our conversations.

### Granting Microphone Permission

The first time you tap the microphone button, your device will ask for permission to access your microphone. This is a standard security step that your phone or computer requires before any app can listen to audio.

**On your phone:**
- When the permission dialog appears, tap **Allow**.
- If you accidentally denied permission, you can fix it by going to your device's **Settings**, finding the Vitanaland app, and enabling microphone access there.

**On your computer:**
- Your browser will show a permission bar at the top of the page. Click **Allow**.
- If you blocked it by mistake, click the lock or settings icon next to the URL in your browser's address bar and change the microphone permission to **Allow**.

### Tips for Better Voice Quality

A few simple adjustments can significantly improve how well I understand you:

- **Minimize background noise.** I do my best to filter out ambient sound, but a quieter environment means fewer misunderstandings.
- **Keep a comfortable distance from your microphone.** You do not need to hold your phone right up to your mouth. A normal speaking distance works well.
- **Use headphones or earbuds when possible.** They reduce echo and feedback, which helps me hear you more clearly.
- **Speak at your natural volume.** You do not need to raise your voice or whisper. Conversational volume is ideal.

## Text-Only Mode

Sometimes voice is not the right fit. Maybe you are in a library, sitting next to someone who is sleeping, in a meeting, or simply in a mood where typing feels more comfortable. I completely understand.

You can use me entirely in text mode without losing any functionality. Everything I can do by voice, I can do by text. The depth of my responses, the personalization, the memory -- none of that changes when you type instead of speak.

To use text mode, simply tap the text input field at the bottom of our conversation instead of the microphone button. Type your message, send it, and I will respond in text.

There is no setting you need to change to switch between modes. You can move freely between voice and text within the same conversation. Start by speaking, then switch to typing when you walk into a quiet space. Or start by typing and switch to voice when you are ready. I carry the context seamlessly across both modes.

## Switching Between Voice and Text Mid-Conversation

You might start a conversation by voice while you are walking and then switch to text when you sit down at your desk. Or you might begin typing a question and then decide it is easier to just say it out loud. Both of these are perfectly fine.

When you switch modes:

- **I keep the full context of our conversation.** You do not need to repeat anything.
- **My responses adapt to the mode you are using.** If you switch to text, I respond in text. If you switch to voice, I respond with voice.
- **The transition is seamless.** There is no lag, no reset, no loss of information.

Think of voice and text as two doorways into the same room. No matter which one you walk through, I am here with the same knowledge, the same attention, and the same focus on your wellbeing.

## Accessibility Considerations

I am built to be usable by everyone, and I take accessibility seriously. Here are some things to know:

**Visual accessibility.** All of my text responses are displayed with clear, readable formatting. The interface supports your device's accessibility settings, including larger text sizes and screen reader compatibility.

**Motor accessibility.** If tapping small buttons is difficult, text mode allows you to interact with me using your keyboard, which may be easier depending on your needs. Voice mode removes the need for typing entirely.

**Hearing accessibility.** If you have difficulty hearing my voice responses, everything I say is also displayed as text on screen. You never need to rely solely on audio to understand what I am telling you.

**Cognitive accessibility.** I adapt my communication style to what works for you. If you prefer shorter, simpler responses, tell me. If you want more detail, tell me that too. I am here to communicate in whatever way is most helpful for you.

If you have specific accessibility needs that are not being met, please let me know. I want our conversations to be comfortable and effective for you, regardless of any limitations you might be working with.

## Voice Preferences

As I learn more about how you like to communicate, I adapt my responses to match. Some aspects of our voice interaction are shaped by your explicit choices, and others are shaped by what I observe over time.

You can tell me directly how you prefer I communicate:

- "Please keep your answers short and to the point."
- "I like it when you explain things in detail."
- "Can you speak more slowly?"
- "I prefer a casual tone."

I take these preferences seriously and apply them not just to the current conversation but to all of our future interactions. The way I talk to you should feel right for you, and your feedback helps me get there.

## Making It Work for Your Life

The reason I offer these options is simple: your longevity journey does not happen in a single setting. You talk to me while commuting, while cooking, while lying in bed, while sitting at your desk, while walking in the park. Each of those moments has different constraints and different possibilities.

By giving you control over language, voice, text, and how we communicate, I make sure that I am accessible to you whenever and wherever you need me. Your wellbeing does not pause because you are in a noisy room or a quiet library. And neither do I.

Set things up in a way that works for your life, and adjust whenever your needs change. I am flexible, and I am always here.
