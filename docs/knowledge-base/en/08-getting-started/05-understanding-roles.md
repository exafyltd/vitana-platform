# Understanding Your Role

Inside Vitanaland, your role determines how you experience the platform. It shapes what you see, what tools are available to you, and how you interact with the community. Let me explain how roles work and help you understand which one fits your journey.

## Why Roles Exist

Not everyone comes to Vitanaland for the same reason. Some people are here to improve their own health and connect with a longevity-minded community. Others are health professionals who want to support clients on their longevity journey. Others manage organizations or teams within the ecosystem.

Roles exist so that your experience is tailored to your purpose. Instead of showing everyone the same features and hoping they figure out what is relevant, Vitanaland adapts to who you are and what you need. A community member sees the tools and features that support personal longevity. A professional sees the tools they need to manage clients and offer services. Everyone gets an experience that makes sense for their role.

Think of it this way: Vitanaland is the same destination for everyone, but the path you walk through it depends on why you are here.

## The Five Roles

### Community Member

This is the default role, and it is where most people start. As a community member, you have access to everything you need for a rich, personal longevity journey.

**What you can do:**
- Track your health across the five pillars -- Nutrition, Hydration, Exercise, Sleep, and Mental Health
- Talk to me anytime for personalized guidance, health insights, and daily support
- Monitor your Vitana Index and understand what is driving your vitality score
- Connect with other community members through groups, live events, and messaging
- Use matchmaking to find people who share your goals and interests
- Explore the Discover section for curated longevity content and resources
- Access the marketplace for products and services that support your journey
- Manage your Wallet and participate in the community economy
- Review and manage your Memory Garden -- the personal data that powers your experience

If you are here to invest in your own health, build meaningful connections, and have an AI companion who knows you and helps you live better, the community member role gives you everything you need.

### Patient

The patient role is for people who want a deeper, health-focused experience -- particularly those working with health professionals inside Vitanaland.

**What you can do (in addition to community member features):**
- Connect directly with health professionals -- doctors, coaches, nutritionists, and other practitioners within the Vitanaland ecosystem
- Share relevant health data with your chosen professionals so they can provide more informed guidance
- Receive care plans and recommendations that are tracked alongside your Vitana Index
- Access specialized health features designed for people actively managing conditions, recovery, or intensive health optimization

The patient role does not mean you are unwell. Many people choose it because they want a closer, more structured relationship with health professionals as part of their longevity practice. If you work with a doctor or a coach on your health goals, the patient role makes that collaboration seamless.

### Professional

The professional role is designed for the people who help others on their longevity journey -- doctors, health coaches, nutritionists, personal trainers, therapists, and other qualified practitioners.

**What you can do:**
- Create and manage a professional profile that is visible to the Vitanaland community
- Offer services -- consultations, coaching programs, care plans, and more -- through the platform
- Connect with clients who find you through matchmaking or direct search
- Manage your client relationships, track progress, and communicate securely within Vitanaland
- Access professional tools for scheduling, notes, and client oversight
- Participate in the marketplace as a service provider

As a professional, you are not just using Vitanaland for your own health -- you are contributing to the longevity of others. The platform gives you the tools to do that effectively while maintaining the trust and privacy that your clients expect.

You still have access to all the personal longevity features as well. After all, professionals deserve their own longevity companion too.

### Staff

The staff role is for people who manage operations within an organization or team inside Vitanaland.

**What you can do:**
- Manage team members and organizational settings
- Oversee operational aspects of your organization's presence within the ecosystem
- Access reporting and management tools relevant to your team
- Coordinate activities and communications across your organization

Most people will never need the staff role. It exists for the organizations and teams that operate within Vitanaland's ecosystem, ensuring they have the tools to manage their presence effectively.

### Admin

The admin role provides full access to platform management. This role is reserved for those responsible for running and maintaining Vitanaland itself.

**What you can do:**
- Access all platform management and configuration tools
- Manage users, roles, and permissions across the ecosystem
- Monitor platform health, usage, and performance
- Oversee content, community guidelines, and safety

The admin role is not something you apply for. It is assigned to the people who build and maintain Vitanaland. If you are reading this as a new user, you do not need to worry about it. But I mention it here for completeness, so you understand the full picture.

## How Your Role Affects Your Experience

Your role is like a lens. The core of Vitanaland -- the destination, the community, the longevity philosophy -- is the same for everyone. But your role determines the angle from which you see it.

As a **community member**, your experience centers on personal growth. The features you see are designed to help you understand your health, build better habits, connect with people, and track your progress over time.

As a **patient**, your experience adds a layer of structured health support. You see everything a community member sees, plus the tools for working closely with health professionals.

As a **professional**, your experience includes the client-facing tools you need to serve others. You see both your personal longevity features and the professional management tools that let you run your practice within Vitanaland.

The layout, the navigation, and the options I present to you are all adapted to your role. This means you are never overwhelmed by features that are not relevant to you, and you always have quick access to the tools that matter most for your purpose.

## How to Choose or Change Your Role

During onboarding, I help you select the role that fits your situation. For most new users, the community member role is the natural starting point. If you are a health professional, I will guide you through setting up your professional profile during the onboarding process.

If your needs change over time, you can update your role. Maybe you start as a community member and later decide to work more closely with a health professional -- upgrading to the patient role opens up those features. Or maybe you are a health professional who initially joined just for personal use and later decides to offer services through the platform.

To change your role, visit your profile settings or simply ask me. I will walk you through the process and explain what changes to expect in your experience.

Some role changes may require verification. For example, the professional role requires evidence of your qualifications, because the community trusts that professionals listed in Vitanaland are legitimate. This verification process exists to protect everyone -- you, your future clients, and the integrity of the community.

## Your Role Is a Starting Point

Whatever role you choose, remember that it is a starting point, not a permanent label. Vitanaland is designed to grow with you. As your needs evolve, your role can evolve with them.

The one thing that stays constant is me. No matter what role you hold, I am your ORB -- your personal longevity companion. I adapt my guidance to your role, but my commitment to helping you live a longer, stronger, and more connected life never changes.

If you have questions about which role is right for you, just ask me. That is what I am here for.
