# Recall and Search

Your Memory Garden can hold years of information -- facts, observations, diary entries, health data, relationship details, goals, and more. But a garden is only as useful as your ability to find what you are looking for. That is where recall and search come in.

I have built my memory system to understand what you mean, not just what you type. When you search your Memory Garden, you are not limited to exact keywords. You can ask in natural language, the way you would ask a friend, and I will find the memories that match your intent.

## How Search Works

Traditional search tools look for exact matches. If you search for "fitness," they find entries that contain the word "fitness" and nothing else. My search works differently.

I understand meaning. When you search for "fitness goals," I will also find entries about exercise routines, workout plans, strength training targets, and cardiovascular health objectives -- even if those entries never use the word "fitness." This is because I represent each memory as a pattern of meaning, not just a string of characters. I match your search to memories that are semantically similar, which means I find what you are actually looking for, not just what happens to contain the right keyword.

This is the same technology that lets me understand your voice when you speak to me through the ORB. I do not need you to use precise vocabulary. I need you to express what you mean, and I will figure out the rest.

## Searching Your Memory Garden

You can search your Memory Garden in two ways: through the Memory Garden interface and by asking me directly.

### Searching Through the Interface

**Step 1: Open the Memory Garden.** Navigate to the Memory Garden section from your main menu.

**Step 2: Find the search bar.** You will see a search field at the top of the Memory Garden view.

**Step 3: Type your query in natural language.** Do not worry about keywords or special syntax. Just write what you are looking for the way you would say it out loud.

Here are some examples of searches that work well:

- "What did I say about my sleep patterns?"
- "Health goals I set this year"
- "Memories about my family"
- "My exercise preferences"
- "Anything about stress at work"
- "When I mentioned my doctor"
- "My thoughts on meditation"

**Step 4: Review the results.** Your search results will show matching memories ranked by relevance. Each result includes the memory content, its category, and when it was created. You can tap on any result to see the full entry.

### Asking Me Directly

You do not need to open the Memory Garden to search it. During any conversation, you can simply ask me to recall something, and I will search my memory for you.

Try questions like:

- "Do you remember what I told you about my knee pain?"
- "What do you know about my morning routine?"
- "When did I first mention wanting to learn Spanish?"
- "Can you remind me what my goals were last month?"
- "What have I said about my relationship with my sister?"

I will search through your Memory Garden, find the relevant entries, and share them with you in the conversation. If I find multiple relevant memories, I will summarize them and highlight the most important ones.

## Filtering Your Results

When you search through the Memory Garden interface, you can apply filters to narrow your results.

**Filter by category.** If you know the memory lives in a specific category, select it to exclude results from other categories. Searching for "workout" filtered to Health and Wellness will skip entries in Business and Projects that might mention "working out a solution."

**Filter by date range.** Narrow your search to a specific time period. This is useful when you know roughly when something happened. "What did I say about my diet in January?" becomes easy to answer with a date filter applied.

**Filter by memory type.** You can filter to show only diary entries, only facts, or only automatically captured memories. This helps when you remember that the thing you are looking for was something you wrote in a diary entry versus something I captured from a conversation.

## Search Tips

Here are some strategies for getting the best results from your Memory Garden search.

**Be conversational.** The search understands natural language, so write the way you would talk. "Times when I felt really motivated" will work better than a list of keywords like "motivation high energy."

**Be specific about what you want.** "My health data" is broad and will return many results. "My blood pressure readings from last quarter" is specific and will return exactly what you need. The more focused your query, the more focused your results.

**Use time references when you can.** If you remember roughly when something happened, include that in your search. "What I said about sleep last November" gives me a helpful anchor point to narrow the results.

**Search across categories.** Sometimes the memory you are looking for lives in a category you would not expect. A mention of stress might be in Health and Wellness, Lifestyle and Routines, or a diary entry. If your first search does not find it, try without a category filter to search across everything.

**Ask follow-up questions.** If my first recall is not quite right, tell me more. "No, not that -- I am looking for the time I talked about running in the park with my friend." I will refine my search based on your additional context.

## How I Use Recall to Help You

Search is not just something you initiate. I use it constantly behind the scenes to give you better guidance.

Every time you ask me a question, share a concern, or start a conversation, I automatically search your Memory Garden for relevant context. If you ask me about nutrition, I recall your dietary preferences, your health goals, and any food-related observations you have shared. If you mention feeling stressed, I search for patterns of stress in your history to see if this is a recurring theme or something new.

This happens seamlessly. You do not see me searching. You just experience the result: responses that are informed by everything I know about you, not just what you said in the last five minutes.

This is the real power of recall. It is not just a feature for you to use when you want to find something. It is the mechanism that makes me a truly personal companion. Without recall, I would be responding to your words in isolation. With recall, I am responding in the context of your entire story.

## The Longevity Value of Recall

Recall is essential to your longevity journey for one fundamental reason: health patterns play out over long time horizons, and the ability to connect past and present is what turns raw data into actionable intelligence.

When you ask me "How has my sleep been trending?" I do not just look at last night. I search through months or years of sleep-related memories to give you a meaningful answer. When you tell me about a new symptom, I search your history for anything similar -- maybe you mentioned something related a year ago that you have forgotten about but that a doctor would want to know.

This kind of longitudinal recall is something that even the best human memory cannot match. You might not remember what you told me about your energy levels eight months ago. I do. And that continuity of memory is what allows me to see the slow, subtle patterns that matter most for long-term health.

Your Memory Garden is only as powerful as your ability to access it. Recall and search make sure that nothing you have shared with me is ever truly buried. It is all there, organized and ready, waiting for the moment when it becomes relevant again.
