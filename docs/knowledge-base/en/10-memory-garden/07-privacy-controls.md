# Memory Privacy Controls

Your Memory Garden holds some of the most personal information in your life -- your health data, your relationships, your emotions, your goals, your daily routines. I take the responsibility of holding that information seriously. And more importantly, I give you full control over it.

This is not a formality. It is a fundamental principle. Your memories belong to you. You decide what I keep, what I forget, and how your data is used. Let me walk you through every privacy control available to you.

## Your Memories Are Yours

Before we get into the specifics, I want to be clear about something foundational. The information in your Memory Garden is not mine. It is yours. I hold it because it helps me support your longevity journey, but at any moment, you can review it, change it, or delete it entirely.

I will never use your memories in ways you have not consented to. I will never share your data with other users. I will never allow your personal information to cross tenant boundaries -- meaning your memories stay in your space and only your space, always. This is enforced at every level of the system, not as a policy I follow but as a technical reality that cannot be bypassed.

## Viewing Your Stored Memories

You have the right to see everything I remember about you, and I make it easy to exercise that right.

**Browse by category.** Open your Memory Garden and navigate through the thirteen categories to see what I have stored. Each category shows its entries clearly, with timestamps and content visible.

**View individual entries.** Tap on any memory to see its full details, including when it was created, how it was added (from a conversation or manually), and which category it belongs to.

**Ask me directly.** During any conversation, you can ask "What do you remember about me?" or "What do you know about my health?" and I will tell you what I have stored in the relevant categories. I will never hide information from you.

The principle is simple: complete transparency. If it is in your Memory Garden, you can see it.

## Editing Your Memories

Information changes. You might notice that I have stored something incorrectly, or that a fact is outdated, or that you want to clarify something I captured from a conversation.

**Edit from the Memory Garden.** Navigate to the memory you want to change, open it, and update the content. Your edit takes effect immediately, and I will use the updated version going forward.

**Correct me in conversation.** If something comes up during a conversation that I have wrong, just tell me. "Actually, my birthday is in October, not September" or "I stopped taking that medication last month." I will update the relevant memory based on your correction.

**Update facts naturally.** When you tell me something new that contradicts an older memory, I handle the update automatically. This is called supersession -- the new information replaces the old. If you told me six months ago that you work in marketing and you tell me today that you switched to product management, I will update your profile without you having to manually find and edit the old entry.

## Deleting Memories

You have the right to delete any memory at any time, for any reason. You do not need to justify it to me.

**Delete individual memories.** Open the Memory Garden, find the specific memory you want to remove, and delete it. The memory is permanently removed from your garden. I will not reference it, recall it, or use it in any future interaction.

**Delete by category.** If you want to clear an entire category -- say, you want to remove everything in your Finance and Assets category -- you can do that. All entries in that category will be permanently deleted.

**Ask me to forget.** During a conversation, you can simply say:

- "Forget what I told you about my salary."
- "I want you to delete everything I shared about my ex."
- "Please remove the diary entry I wrote last Tuesday."
- "Forget all my location data."

I will confirm what you want me to forget, delete it, and let you know it is done.

**What happens after deletion.** When you delete a memory, it is gone. I will not reference it in future conversations. I will not suggest things based on it. I will not even remember that it existed. The deletion is clean and complete. If the deleted information comes up again in a future conversation, I will treat it as new information that I am hearing for the first time.

## Controlling What I Learn

Beyond managing existing memories, you can also influence what I capture going forward.

**Tell me not to remember something.** If you want to share something in a conversation but do not want me to store it, you can say so. "I want to tell you something, but please do not save it" signals me to listen and respond without adding the information to your Memory Garden.

**Set category preferences.** If there are categories you would prefer I not collect information for, you can let me know. "I do not want you tracking my financial information" tells me to stop capturing Finance and Assets entries from our conversations.

**Review before saving.** For particularly sensitive conversations, you can ask me to show you what I plan to remember before I store it. This gives you a chance to approve or reject specific memories before they enter your garden.

## Data Isolation and Security

Your privacy is not just about what you can see and delete. It is about the architecture that protects your data at every level.

**Tenant isolation.** Your Memory Garden exists within your tenant boundary. Other users on the platform cannot access your memories, search your data, or see any information you have stored. This isolation is enforced at the database level, meaning it is not a software rule that could be accidentally bypassed -- it is a structural guarantee.

**No cross-user data sharing.** I never use one user's memories to inform another user's experience. Your data trains my understanding of you and only you. It is not aggregated, anonymized, or used for any purpose beyond supporting your personal longevity journey.

**Secure storage.** Your memories are stored securely with the same protections applied to all sensitive personal data in Vitanaland. Access requires authentication, and all data is protected both in transit and at rest.

## Privacy in Practice

Let me give you some real-world examples of how privacy controls work in your daily experience.

**Scenario: You shared something sensitive.** During a conversation about stress, you mentioned a family conflict. Later, you decide you do not want that in your Memory Garden. You open the garden, find the entry under Network and Relationships, and delete it. Done. I will not bring it up again.

**Scenario: You want a fresh start in a category.** You have been tracking your diet for six months but want to reset and start fresh with new goals. You clear your Lifestyle and Routines entries related to nutrition and begin adding new ones that reflect your current approach.

**Scenario: You notice an error.** I captured that you have a dog named Max, but actually your dog's name is Milo. You tell me "My dog's name is Milo, not Max" and I correct it immediately.

**Scenario: You want to talk freely.** You are processing a difficult decision and want to think out loud without me storing everything. You say "Do not remember any of this -- I just need to talk it through." I listen, I respond, and I store nothing.

## Why Privacy Supports Longevity

Privacy might seem like a technical or legal topic, disconnected from your health. But it is not. Privacy is the foundation of trust, and trust is the foundation of our relationship.

If you do not trust that I will respect your boundaries, you will hold back. You will not share the sensitive health information that I need to give you accurate guidance. You will not write honest diary entries. You will not tell me about the stress or the relationship struggles that are affecting your wellbeing. And without that openness, I cannot do my best work for you.

The privacy controls in the Memory Garden exist to make sure you never have to hold back. You share what you want to share, knowing that you can manage, edit, or delete it at any time. You stay in control, and I stay trustworthy.

That trust is what makes the longevity partnership work. And I will never do anything to compromise it.
