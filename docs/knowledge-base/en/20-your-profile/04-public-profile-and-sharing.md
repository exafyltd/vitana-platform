# Your Public Profile and Sharing

When someone in the Vitanaland community visits your profile, what do they see? And what do you want them to see? Your public profile is the face you present to the community -- the combination of your photo, your bio, your interests, and your activity that tells others who you are and what you are about. Understanding how it works and how to manage it puts you in control of your presence here. Let me walk you through it.

## What Others See

When a community member views your profile, they see the public elements you have chosen to share:

**Your display name and photo.** These are always visible to other members. They are the foundation of your identity within the community and the first thing people notice.

**Your cover image.** The banner at the top of your profile page creates the visual atmosphere of your personal space.

**Your bio.** Your personal introduction -- the few sentences that tell others who you are, what you are working on, and what brings you to Vitanaland.

**Your interests.** The wellness and longevity topics you have selected as interests are visible to others. This helps community members quickly identify what you have in common.

**Your links.** Any external links you have added -- websites, social profiles, published work -- are visible on your public profile.

**Your badges and achievements.** Milestones you have reached, streaks you have maintained, programs you have completed, and community recognition you have earned are displayed as badges. These are markers of your engagement and consistency that build credibility.

**Your community activity.** Your participation in communities, events, and discussions is reflected on your profile. Members can see which groups you belong to and what kind of engagement you contribute. This helps potential connections understand how active and involved you are.

## What Others Do Not See

Some information is private by default and never visible to other members unless you explicitly choose to share it:

**Your health data.** Your pillar tracking, your Vitana Index score, your health trends, and your specific wellness goals are private. No one can see your sleep data, your nutrition logs, or your exercise records. This data is between you and me.

**Your wallet details.** Your balance, your transactions, your earnings, and your financial activity are private. Other members cannot see what you earn, what you spend, or what you have in your wallet.

**Your conversations with me.** Everything we discuss is private. Your Memory Garden, your personal reflections, and the guidance I give you are never visible to other members.

**Your detailed matchmaking data.** The signals the matchmaking system uses to connect you with others are processed internally. Members you are matched with do not see the specific data points behind the match -- they see your public profile and decide whether to connect based on that.

## Privacy Settings

You have control over the visibility of your profile through privacy settings. Here is what you can adjust:

**Profile visibility.** You can choose whether your profile is discoverable through search and matchmaking, or whether it is only visible to people you have already connected with. Most members benefit from being discoverable, because that is how new connections form. But if you prefer a more private presence, the option is there.

**Interest visibility.** You can choose to show or hide your interests on your public profile. Showing them helps with matchmaking and community suggestions. Hiding them gives you more privacy but reduces the signals available for personalization.

**Activity visibility.** You can control whether your community participation -- group memberships, event attendance, discussion contributions -- is visible on your profile. Some members prefer that their community activity speaks for itself. Others prefer a more discreet presence.

**Badge display.** You can choose which badges appear on your profile. If you have earned recognition you would rather keep private, you can hide specific badges while displaying others.

These settings are available in your profile privacy section and can be changed at any time. Adjustments take effect immediately.

## The Relationship Between Visibility and Connection

I want to share something I have observed. Members who maintain a more open, visible profile tend to form more and deeper connections within the community. This is not a coincidence. It is how human connection works.

When someone views your profile and sees a thoughtful bio, genuine interests, a real photo, and evidence of active community participation, they feel like they know something about you. That familiarity lowers the barrier to reaching out. It makes the first message feel less like a cold contact and more like the beginning of a conversation between two people who might have something in common.

Conversely, a sparse or hidden profile creates distance. Other members are less likely to reach out because they have nothing to connect with. The matchmaking system has fewer signals to work with, so the connections it suggests are less precise.

I am not saying you must share everything. Your privacy is yours to manage, and every choice about what to show or hide is valid. But I do want you to understand the trade-off. Visibility invites connection. Connection supports longevity. The more you share of yourself -- within your comfort zone -- the more the community can offer you in return.

## Sharing Your Profile Externally

Your public profile has a shareable link that you can send to anyone, even people who are not yet members of Vitanaland.

### How to Share

1. Go to your profile page.
2. Tap the Share option.
3. Copy the link or share it directly through your preferred messaging or social platform.

When someone who is not a member visits your profile link, they see a preview of your public profile and an invitation to join Vitanaland. This makes your profile link a natural way to introduce people you know to the community.

### When to Share

Your profile link is useful in several situations:

**Community events and meetups.** When you meet someone at a longevity event -- virtual or in-person -- sharing your profile link is the fastest way to connect inside the platform.

**Professional networking.** If you use the Business Hub, your profile link is a convenient way to direct potential clients to your professional presence inside Vitanaland.

**Personal invitations.** When you invite friends or family to join the community, sending your profile link along with the invitation gives them an immediate sense of who you are in this space and what it is about.

**Social media and online presence.** Adding your Vitanaland profile link to your social media bios or personal websites lets people from other parts of your life discover your presence here.

## Your Profile as a Community Asset

Here is a perspective I want to offer. Your profile is not just about you. It is about the community.

Every complete, authentic, active profile makes Vitanaland a better place. When new members browse the community and see profiles that are genuine, detailed, and reflective of real people on real health journeys, it signals that this is a place worth being. It encourages them to complete their own profiles, to share their own stories, to engage authentically.

Your profile contributes to the culture of the community. When you are open about your goals, honest about your journey, and present in your interactions, you set an example that others follow. That ripple effect strengthens the social fabric that longevity depends on.

You are not performing for an audience. You are participating in a community. Your profile is how that participation begins.
