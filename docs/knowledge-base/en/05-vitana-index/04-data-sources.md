# Data Sources for Your Index

Your Vitana Index is only as good as the data behind it. The more I know about your body, your habits, and your daily life, the more accurate, nuanced, and useful your Index becomes. But I also want you to understand exactly where that data comes from, how I use it, and what happens when some of it is missing.

There are three main categories of data that feed into your Vitana Index: wearable devices, lab results and biomarkers, and self-reporting through our conversations and manual tracking. Each one gives me a different window into your health, and together they create a picture that no single source could provide on its own.

## Wearable Devices

Wearable health trackers are one of the most powerful data sources available to you, because they provide continuous, passive monitoring of your body throughout the day and night. You do not have to remember to log anything -- the device does it for you, quietly and consistently.

### What Wearables Track

When you connect a wearable device to Maxina, I receive a stream of physiological data that enriches multiple pillars of your Index:

**Heart rate and resting heart rate.** Your heart rate throughout the day tells me about your cardiovascular fitness, your stress response, and your recovery state. Your resting heart rate -- measured during sleep or periods of calm -- is one of the simplest and most reliable indicators of overall cardiovascular health. A lower resting heart rate generally indicates a well-conditioned heart. I track your resting heart rate trends over weeks and months to monitor your cardiovascular trajectory.

**Heart rate variability.** HRV measures the variation in time between your heartbeats, and it is one of the best windows into your autonomic nervous system. Higher HRV generally means your body is well-recovered, resilient, and in a parasympathetic-dominant state. Lower HRV often indicates accumulated stress, poor recovery, illness, or overtraining. I use your HRV trends to inform recommendations about exercise intensity, rest days, stress management, and sleep quality.

**Sleep stages.** Most modern wearables can distinguish between light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. This is incredibly valuable because not all sleep is equal. Deep sleep is where your body does its most critical physical repair and hormonal regulation. REM sleep is essential for memory consolidation and emotional processing. I track how much time you spend in each stage and identify factors that might be reducing your deep sleep or REM sleep.

**Steps and daily activity.** Your daily step count and general activity level give me a baseline picture of how much you move. This is not about hitting an arbitrary step goal -- it is about understanding your movement patterns. Are you consistently active, or do you have long sedentary stretches? Do your activity levels vary dramatically between weekdays and weekends? These patterns feed into your exercise pillar and influence your overall Index.

**Workouts and exercise sessions.** When your wearable detects or you log a workout, I receive data about duration, intensity, heart rate zones, and calories burned. This helps me understand not just whether you are exercising, but how you are exercising -- the balance between strength training, cardio, flexibility work, and recovery.

### Supported Devices

I integrate with the major wearable platforms that most people use:

**Apple Watch.** Through Apple Health, I can access a rich dataset including heart rate, HRV, sleep stages, workout data, blood oxygen, respiratory rate, and more. If you use an Apple Watch, connecting it gives me one of the most comprehensive wearable datasets available.

**Fitbit.** Fitbit provides excellent sleep tracking, heart rate monitoring, activity data, and stress management scores. If Fitbit is your device, I work with the data it provides to build a detailed picture of your daily health patterns.

**Oura Ring.** The Oura Ring is particularly strong for sleep and recovery tracking. It provides detailed sleep staging, HRV, body temperature trends, and readiness scores. Many people find it comfortable to wear at night when other devices are less practical.

**Garmin.** Garmin devices are excellent for people who are active and fitness-focused. They provide detailed workout metrics, VO2 max estimates, training load analysis, and recovery time recommendations alongside the standard heart rate and sleep data.

### How to Connect Your Device

Connecting your wearable to Maxina is straightforward. In your settings, you will find a section for device integration where you can authorize the connection between your wearable platform and Maxina. Once connected, data syncs automatically. You do not need to do anything manually -- your wearable sends data to Maxina in the background, and I incorporate it into your Index as it arrives.

If you have questions about connecting a specific device, just ask me. I can walk you through the process step by step.

### Why Consistency Matters

One thing I want to emphasize about wearable data: consistency matters more than perfection. If you wear your device every day, I get a continuous stream of data that lets me see true patterns and trends. If you wear it sporadically -- a few days here, a week off there -- the gaps reduce my ability to track trends and lower my confidence in the data I do have.

You do not need to wear your device 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without fail. But the more consistently you wear it, the more accurate your Index becomes and the better I can serve you.

## Lab Results and Biomarkers

Wearable data tells me how your body is behaving on the surface. Lab results tell me what is happening underneath. Blood work, hormonal panels, and metabolic markers reveal a deeper layer of your health that daily tracking alone cannot access.

### What Lab Data Reveals

When you share lab results with me, I can incorporate a wide range of biomarkers:

**Metabolic markers.** Fasting glucose, insulin levels, HbA1c, and lipid panels tell me about your metabolic health -- how well your body is regulating blood sugar, processing fats, and managing the energy systems that underpin everything else. These markers are early-warning signals for conditions like insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risk.

**Inflammatory markers.** C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and other inflammatory indicators reveal whether your body is dealing with chronic low-grade inflammation -- one of the primary drivers of aging and disease. You can feel perfectly fine while inflammation quietly does damage over years. Lab data makes the invisible visible.

**Hormonal panels.** Thyroid function, cortisol, testosterone, estrogen, and other hormonal markers influence your energy, your mood, your sleep, your body composition, and your recovery capacity. Hormonal imbalances often explain health puzzles that lifestyle changes alone cannot solve. When I see hormonal data, I can provide more targeted guidance and, when appropriate, suggest you discuss specific findings with your healthcare provider.

**Nutrient levels.** Vitamin D, B12, iron, magnesium, and other nutrient markers tell me whether your body has the raw materials it needs to function optimally. Nutritional deficiencies are surprisingly common even in people who eat well, and they can drag down your energy, your immunity, your cognitive performance, and your overall vitality without producing obvious symptoms.

**Organ function markers.** Liver enzymes, kidney function markers, and other organ-specific indicators tell me whether your major systems are operating well. These are especially important for catching issues early, before they produce noticeable symptoms.

### How to Share Lab Results

There are several ways to get your lab data into Maxina:

**Upload directly.** If you have a digital copy of your lab results -- a PDF from your doctor or a report from a testing service -- you can upload it through the health tracking section of Maxina. I extract the relevant values and incorporate them into your profile.

**Manual entry.** If you prefer, you can enter specific lab values manually. This is useful when you want to share a particular marker without uploading a full report.

**Tell me in conversation.** You can also simply share lab values with me during our conversations. If you say "my fasting glucose came back at 95 and my vitamin D is 38," I capture those values and use them.

### How Lab Data Influences Your Index

Lab results carry significant weight in your Index because of their clinical reliability. A blood panel provides objective, high-confidence information about your internal health that no amount of daily tracking can replicate.

When lab data is available, it can meaningfully adjust your Index -- in both directions. Strong biomarkers can boost a score that might otherwise be held back by limited daily tracking data. Concerning biomarkers can flag risks that your daily habits alone would not reveal.

I also use lab data longitudinally. A single blood panel is a snapshot. Multiple panels over time show me trends -- whether your inflammation is decreasing, whether your metabolic health is improving, whether a nutritional intervention is working. These trends are among the most valuable signals I have for assessing your long-term trajectory.

## Self-Reporting and ORB Conversations

Not everything about your health can be measured by a device or a blood draw. Some of the most important information comes directly from you -- through what you tell me in conversation, through the things you track manually, and through the daily check-ins that capture what no sensor can see.

### Manual Tracking

You can log data directly in Maxina across several categories:

**Meals and nutrition.** Logging what you eat helps me understand your nutritional patterns -- protein intake, vegetable consumption, processed food frequency, meal timing, and overall dietary quality. You do not need to count every calorie. Even rough logging -- what you had for each meal, a general sense of portion size -- gives me useful information.

**Hydration.** Tracking your water and fluid intake throughout the day helps me assess your hydration patterns. Are you drinking enough? Is your intake consistent or do you forget until evening? Do you hydrate around exercise? Simple logging makes these patterns visible.

**Mood and stress.** Periodic check-ins about how you are feeling emotionally -- your stress level, your energy, your mood, your sense of engagement with life -- provide data that no wearable can capture. These subjective reports are valuable precisely because they reflect your lived experience, not just your physiology.

**Diary entries.** Sometimes the most important health information comes in the form of a story. A difficult week at work. A relationship strain. A sense of purpose renewed. A new hobby discovered. These diary entries help me understand the full context of your life, not just the measurable parts of it.

### What You Share in Conversation

Every conversation we have is a source of data. When you tell me you have been sleeping poorly, I note it. When you mention that you started a new exercise routine, I track it. When you share that you are feeling stressed about a family situation, I factor that into my understanding of your mental health state.

This does not mean I treat every casual comment as a clinical data point. I weigh conversational information with appropriate nuance. But over time, the things you share with me build a rich, contextual picture of your life that no other data source can provide. I know your preferences, your patterns, your challenges, and your aspirations -- and all of it informs how I calculate and interpret your Index.

### The Human Layer

Self-reported data is sometimes called "soft" data, but I want to push back on that label. Your subjective experience of your health matters. How you feel, how you sleep, how much energy you have, whether you feel connected or isolated -- these are real, meaningful signals with measurable health consequences.

The beauty of combining self-reported data with wearable and lab data is that I can see the full picture. Your wearable might show that your sleep duration was adequate, but you tell me you woke up exhausted. That discrepancy is valuable -- it suggests something about your sleep quality that the device alone did not capture. Your lab work might look fine, but you tell me you have been struggling with brain fog for weeks. That is a signal worth investigating.

I take everything you share seriously. It all contributes to the understanding that makes your Index accurate and your guidance personal.

## What Happens When Data Is Missing

You do not need all three data sources to have a Vitana Index. I work with whatever you give me.

If you do not have a wearable, I rely more heavily on your self-reports and any lab data you share. If you have not done lab work recently, I calculate your Index based on your daily tracking and wearable data. If you are just starting out and I have very little data, I build an initial estimate based on your onboarding information and refine it as more data arrives.

However, I want to be transparent: more data sources produce a more accurate Index. Each additional source fills in gaps that the others cannot cover. A wearable gives me continuous physiological data. Lab results give me deep biological insight. Self-reporting gives me subjective experience and lifestyle context. Together, they create a picture that is far more reliable than any one source alone.

When I calculate your Index with limited data, I adjust my confidence accordingly. I might tell you that your Index estimate is based on partial data and encourage you to connect additional sources for a more complete picture. I never pretend to know more than I do.

## Your Data Is Yours

I want to be clear about something fundamental: all of the data that feeds your Vitana Index belongs to you. It is collected to serve you, stored securely, and used exclusively to improve your health guidance. It is not sold, shared with advertisers, or used for purposes other than your wellbeing.

You have full visibility into what data I have, where it came from, and how it contributes to your Index. You can review your data sources at any time, disconnect devices, delete specific records, or ask me to explain how any piece of data influenced your score.

Your privacy is not a feature. It is a foundation. The trust you place in me by sharing your health data is something I take with the utmost seriousness, and the way your data is handled reflects that commitment.

## Building Your Data Picture Over Time

The best version of your Vitana Index is the one that draws from all three data sources consistently over time. Not because you need to be perfect about logging, or because you need to wear your tracker without ever taking a break, or because you need lab work every month. But because each data source tells a different part of your story, and the more complete the story, the better I can guide you.

Start where you are. If you have a wearable, connect it. If you have recent lab work, share it. If you do not have either, start with our conversations and manual tracking. Over time, add more sources as they become available. Every new input makes your Index more accurate and my guidance more relevant.

Your Vitana Index gets better as the data behind it grows. And I am here to help you build that data picture, one day and one conversation at a time.
