# Joining a Live Room

You are about to step into a real-time conversation with people who share your commitment to living longer and living better. Joining a Live Room is simple, and I want to walk you through every step so you feel confident and comfortable from the moment you enter.

## Finding Active Live Rooms

There are several ways to discover Live Rooms that are happening right now or coming up soon.

**The Live Rooms Section.** This is the dedicated space where all Live Rooms are listed. You will see rooms that are currently active -- already in session with people inside -- as well as rooms that are scheduled for later today, this week, or beyond. Active rooms are marked clearly so you can tell at a glance which ones you can join right now.

**Your Community Feed.** When a group you belong to has a live room in progress or one coming up soon, it appears in your feed. This is one of the most natural ways to discover rooms -- they surface where you are already looking.

**My Recommendations.** Based on your interests, your health goals, and the groups you belong to, I suggest Live Rooms that I think you will enjoy. When I see a room that aligns with something you care about, I let you know.

**Event Listings.** Many Live Rooms are organized as community events, complete with RSVP and reminders. If you have RSVPed to an upcoming live event, I send you a notification when it starts so you can join with one tap.

For each room, you will see the topic, the host, the number of participants currently inside, and how long the session has been running. This gives you everything you need to decide whether to join.

## How to Join

When you find a room you want to enter, tap the Join button. That is it. The room opens, and you are in.

Before you enter, you will have a brief moment to configure your participation mode:

**Join with Audio and Video.** This is the fullest way to participate. Your camera and microphone are active, and you can see and be seen by other participants. This mode is ideal for small, interactive discussions where face-to-face connection matters.

**Join with Audio Only.** Your microphone is active, but your camera is off. You can speak and be heard, but others will see your profile picture instead of a live video feed. This is a great option when you want to participate in the conversation but prefer not to be on camera -- maybe you are on a walk, in a casual setting, or simply more comfortable with audio.

**Join as a Listener.** Both your camera and microphone are off. You can see and hear everything that is happening in the room, but you are not broadcasting anything. This is the lowest-pressure way to experience a Live Room, and it is perfectly welcome. Many members start as listeners and move to more active participation over time.

You can switch between these modes at any time during the session. Start as a listener, and if the conversation inspires you to speak up, unmute and join in. There is no commitment to one mode.

## Audio and Video Controls

Once you are inside a room, your controls are accessible at the bottom of the screen, designed to be simple and unobtrusive:

**Microphone Toggle.** Tap to mute or unmute yourself. When you are not speaking, keeping yourself muted is good practice -- it reduces background noise for everyone else. When you want to contribute, tap to unmute and speak.

**Camera Toggle.** Turn your video on or off at any time. Some rooms are video-focused, while others are primarily audio with optional video. Follow the room's vibe, or simply do what is comfortable for you.

**Raise Hand.** In larger rooms with structured discussions, the raise-hand feature lets you signal that you want to speak without interrupting. The host sees your request and can invite you to speak when there is a natural opening. This keeps the conversation flowing smoothly.

**Reactions.** Quick emoji reactions let you respond to what is being said without unmuting. Applause for a great point. A heart for something that resonated. A thumbs-up for agreement. These small signals make speakers feel heard and keep the room's energy alive, even from listeners.

**Leave Room.** When you are ready to go, tap the leave button. You exit quietly without disrupting the session. No announcement, no fanfare. You can slip out as gracefully as you slipped in.

## Room Etiquette

Every good gathering has a rhythm, and Live Rooms are no different. Here are a few simple guidelines that help everyone have a positive experience:

**Be present.** When you join a room, give it your attention. Even as a listener, being genuinely present -- rather than half-listening while doing something else -- makes the experience richer for you and contributes positively to the room's energy.

**Respect the speaker.** When someone is talking, let them finish. Avoid talking over others. If the room uses a raise-hand system, use it. In smaller, casual rooms, the flow is more conversational, but awareness of others is always appreciated.

**Keep it supportive.** The community is built on mutual respect and encouragement. Share your perspective honestly, but always with kindness. Disagree thoughtfully when you do. And remember that everyone in the room is on their own health journey, at their own pace.

**Manage your environment.** If you are joining from a noisy location, use mute when you are not speaking. If your video background is distracting, consider turning the camera off or using a background blur if available. Small considerations like these improve the experience for everyone.

**It is okay to just listen.** I want to repeat this because it matters. You do not need to speak to belong. Listening is a form of participation. Many of the most valued community members spend most of their time in rooms simply absorbing, learning, and being present. Never feel pressured to contribute verbally if that is not what you want to do.

## What to Expect When You Enter

The first few seconds in a Live Room can feel unfamiliar if you have not done this before. Here is what typically happens:

You enter the room and see the host and other participants. If the session is in progress, you join mid-conversation -- that is completely normal. Take a moment to listen and get a sense of what is being discussed. The host may acknowledge new arrivals with a quick welcome, or the conversation may continue naturally. Either way, you are welcome.

If the room is just starting, the host usually opens with an introduction -- explaining the topic, setting the tone, and inviting participants to introduce themselves. This is a warm, low-pressure way to ease into the session.

Within a few minutes, you will likely feel the room's rhythm. Some rooms are energetic and fast-paced. Others are calm and reflective. Both are valuable. Let yourself settle into whatever the room offers.

## Leaving a Room

When you are ready to leave -- whether after five minutes or fifty -- simply tap the leave button. There is no obligation to stay for the entire session. Life happens, schedules shift, and sometimes you have gotten what you needed and it is time to move on. The community understands.

If the session was particularly valuable to you, consider checking back later for highlights or a summary. Many Live Room sessions generate AI summaries that capture the key points discussed, so you can revisit the content even after you have left.
