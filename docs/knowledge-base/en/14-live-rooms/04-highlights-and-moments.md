# Highlights and Moments

Some of the best insights, breakthroughs, and connections happen during live conversations. A member shares a nutrition strategy that changed their life. A group meditation reaches a moment of genuine collective stillness. Someone asks a question that shifts the entire room's perspective. These moments are valuable -- and they deserve to be preserved.

Highlights and Moments is the feature that captures the best parts of your Live Room sessions so they can be revisited, shared, and appreciated long after the room has closed.

## What Are Highlights?

Highlights are saved segments from live room sessions. Think of them as bookmarks in a conversation -- the parts that mattered most, extracted and preserved for future reference.

A highlight captures a specific window of time from a session. It might be thirty seconds of someone sharing a powerful insight, two minutes of a guided breathing exercise, or a brief exchange between participants that captured something meaningful. The highlight includes the audio and, if applicable, the video from that moment.

Highlights are not full recordings of entire sessions. They are curated moments -- the peaks of a conversation, the segments that are worth keeping.

## How to Capture a Highlight

During a live room session, any participant can capture a highlight. Here is how it works:

**While the Session Is Active.** When you hear or see something worth preserving, tap the Highlight button in your room controls. This marks the moment. The system captures a segment of the conversation around that point -- typically including a few seconds before your tap (so the beginning of the moment is not lost) and continuing for a brief window after.

**Set a Title.** After capturing, you have the option to add a short title or description to your highlight. "Sarah's sleep routine that improved her energy" or "Group breathwork -- minute three" helps you and others understand what the highlight contains when browsing later.

**Automatic Capture.** In some sessions, the host may enable automatic highlight detection. When this is active, I listen for moments that seem particularly significant -- extended applause, emotional peaks, or passages that multiple participants react to -- and suggest them as potential highlights. The host or participants can confirm or dismiss these suggestions.

## Viewing Highlights After a Session

Once a Live Room ends, all captured highlights from that session are available for review. You can find them in several places:

**The Session Summary.** When a room closes, a session summary is generated that includes all highlights from that conversation. This is the most natural place to review what was captured, because you can see the highlights in the context of the full session.

**The Live Rooms Archive.** Past sessions and their associated highlights are stored in the Live Rooms archive. You can browse previous sessions, see which ones have highlights, and watch or listen to the saved moments.

**The Community Media Hub.** Highlights that are shared to the community flow into the Media Hub, where they become part of the broader visual and audio record of community life. This is how highlights reach people who were not in the original session.

**Your Personal Collection.** You can save highlights to your own collection for easy access. If there is a breathing exercise you want to revisit, a motivational moment you want to replay, or a piece of advice you do not want to forget, saving it to your collection keeps it within reach.

## Sharing Highlights

Highlights are meant to be shared. When you capture or find a highlight that you think others would benefit from, you have several ways to share it:

**Share to a Group.** Post the highlight in a community group where the content is relevant. A nutrition insight from a live session might be perfect for your healthy eating group. A fitness tip might resonate in your exercise community.

**Share to the Media Hub.** Publishing a highlight to the Media Hub makes it visible to the broader community. This is ideal for moments that have universal value -- insights that are not specific to one group but could benefit anyone.

**Share with Individuals.** Send a highlight directly to a friend or community member. This is a personal, thoughtful way to say "I heard this and thought of you."

Sharing highlights extends the value of a live session far beyond the people who were present. A single insight captured in a highlight can reach hundreds of members, spark new conversations, and inspire people who never attended the original session.

## Why Moments Matter

Live conversations are ephemeral by nature. They happen, they flow, and then they are gone. That ephemerality is part of what makes them special -- the feeling of being present for something unrepeatable. But some moments carry wisdom, inspiration, or emotional weight that deserves to last beyond the session.

Highlights bridge that gap. They preserve the best of the live experience while letting the rest remain in the natural flow of conversation. You get the permanence of recorded content with the authenticity of real-time exchange.

For your longevity journey specifically, highlights serve as a growing library of community wisdom. Over months and years of live room participation, the highlights you and others capture become a rich, searchable collection of health insights, wellness practices, personal stories, and collective knowledge. This is not generic information pulled from the internet. It is lived experience, shared by real people in your community, captured in the moment it mattered most.

## Creating Lasting Value from Live Conversations

The most impactful Live Room hosts think about highlights as part of their session design. They know that a great session produces two kinds of value: the immediate experience of being present, and the lasting value of the moments that are preserved.

If you host sessions, encourage participants to capture highlights when something resonates. Mention it at the beginning of the room: "If you hear something worth saving, tap the highlight button." This creates a culture of preservation that benefits the entire community.

Over time, the highlights from your sessions become a portfolio of the value you have created -- a record of the insights you have facilitated, the connections you have enabled, and the moments of genuine human exchange you have made possible.
