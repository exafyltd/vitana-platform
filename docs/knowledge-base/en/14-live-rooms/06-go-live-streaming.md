# Go Live Streaming

Sometimes you have something to share with your entire community -- not in a conversation, not in a discussion, but as a broadcast. A wellness talk you have been preparing. A cooking demonstration of a longevity-boosting recipe. An announcement that matters to everyone. A guided workout that dozens of people can follow along with. That is what Go Live is for.

Go Live lets you broadcast to your community in real time. It is one-to-many streaming, designed for moments when you want to reach a large audience with a focused message or experience.

## How Go Live Differs from Live Rooms

This is an important distinction, so let me be clear about it.

**Live Rooms are interactive.** They are conversations. Everyone can speak, participate, and contribute. They are designed for dialogue -- small to medium groups of people engaging with each other in real time. Think of a Live Room as a round table.

**Go Live is a broadcast.** You are the presenter, and your community watches. Viewers can interact through comments and reactions, but the primary flow of content is from you to them. Think of Go Live as a stage.

Both are valuable. Both serve longevity. But they serve different purposes. Use a Live Room when you want a conversation. Use Go Live when you want to deliver content to a broader audience.

There is one more distinction worth mentioning. You may have noticed **Start Stream** in your sidebar. Start Stream is a completely separate feature -- it is your private AI-powered screen share, where you work one-on-one with me for personal assistance. Start Stream is not a community feature. Go Live is the community broadcast tool. They are different features for different purposes.

## How to Start a Broadcast

Starting a Go Live broadcast is straightforward. From the Live Rooms section, select the Go Live option. You will set up your broadcast with a few essential details.

**Title.** Give your broadcast a clear, compelling title. "Morning Mobility Routine -- 15 Minutes to Start Your Day" tells viewers exactly what they are getting. A good title attracts the right audience and sets expectations.

**Description.** Add a brief description that elaborates on what you will cover. Who is this for? What should viewers expect? How long will it last? A few sentences are enough to give people the information they need to decide whether to tune in.

**Start Immediately or Schedule.** You can go live right now, or schedule your broadcast for a future time. Scheduling gives you time to promote the broadcast and lets your audience plan to attend. When you schedule, the broadcast appears in the community events feed and I notify relevant members.

Once you are ready, tap the Go Live button. Your camera activates, your broadcast begins, and you are live.

## During Your Broadcast

While you are broadcasting, you have several tools at your disposal.

**Camera and Audio.** Your camera and microphone are active throughout the broadcast. You are the visual and audio center of the stream. Make sure you are in a well-lit space with clear audio -- your viewers' experience depends on it.

**Viewer Count.** You can see how many people are watching in real time. This number fluctuates as people join and leave, which is completely normal for any broadcast. Focus on delivering great content, not on the number.

**Comments and Reactions.** Your viewers can send comments and reactions during the broadcast. These appear in a stream alongside your video. You can read and respond to comments in real time, which makes the broadcast feel more connected and interactive even though the primary content flow is one-directional.

Engaging with viewer comments is one of the best ways to make a broadcast feel personal. When someone asks a question, answer it. When someone shares a reaction, acknowledge it. This turns a broadcast from a lecture into a shared experience.

**Duration.** There is no strict time limit on a Go Live broadcast, but be mindful of your audience's attention. Most effective broadcasts run between fifteen and sixty minutes, depending on the content. A guided workout might be thirty minutes. A wellness talk might be twenty. A cooking demonstration might be forty-five. Match the length to the content.

## Viewer Interaction

Even though Go Live is a one-to-many format, viewers are not passive. They have ways to engage that keep the broadcast feeling alive and connected.

**Comments.** Viewers can type comments that appear in the broadcast's chat stream. They might ask questions, share their own experiences related to your topic, or simply express appreciation. A healthy comment stream makes a broadcast more engaging for everyone -- including you as the host.

**Reactions.** Quick emoji reactions let viewers respond in real time without typing. Hearts, applause, fire, and thumbs-up emojis flow across the screen during moments that resonate. These reactions give you instant feedback about what is landing with your audience.

**Sharing.** Viewers can share your broadcast with others, extending your reach. When someone finds your stream valuable, they can invite friends or post it in a group, bringing more viewers into the experience.

## Ending and Saving Your Stream

When you are finished, tap the End Broadcast button. Your stream closes, viewers are notified, and the broadcast wraps up.

After the broadcast ends, you have the option to save it. A saved broadcast remains accessible in the community -- viewers who missed the live experience can watch the recording on their own time. This is especially valuable for educational content, guided workouts, and demonstrations that people want to follow along with at their own pace.

Saved broadcasts live in the Live Rooms archive and can be shared to the Community Media Hub. They become a permanent part of the community's content library, continuing to provide value long after the live moment has passed.

If you prefer not to save the broadcast -- maybe it was a casual announcement or something you only intended for the live audience -- you can choose not to save, and the stream is not retained.

## Use Cases for Go Live

Go Live shines in situations where you want to reach many people with a focused experience. Here are some of the most effective uses:

**Wellness Talks.** Share your knowledge or experience on a health topic. You might talk about your journey with intermittent fasting, what you have learned about managing stress, or how a specific supplement changed your energy levels. Personal, authentic talks resonate deeply with community audiences.

**Guided Workouts and Movement Sessions.** Lead a fitness session that dozens of people can follow along with simultaneously. Yoga flows, stretching routines, bodyweight circuits, dance fitness, or simple walking prompts -- movement broadcasts turn individual exercise into a communal experience.

**Demonstrations.** Show people how to do something. Cook a longevity-boosting meal in real time. Walk through a meditation technique. Demonstrate a stretching routine. Set up a home wellness space. Visual demonstrations are one of the most engaging broadcast formats because viewers learn by watching you do it.

**Announcements and Updates.** Community leaders and group organizers can use Go Live to make announcements, share updates, or address the community directly. There is a personal quality to a live video announcement that a text post cannot match.

**Celebrations and Milestones.** Hit a health milestone? Completed a longevity program? Want to celebrate a group achievement? Go Live lets you share that moment with your community in real time, turning personal victories into shared joy.

## A Note About Start Stream

I mentioned this earlier, but it bears repeating because the distinction matters. **Start Stream**, which you will find in your sidebar, is not the same as Go Live. Start Stream is a private feature where you and I work together one-on-one. It involves AI-powered screen sharing for personal assistance -- it is your private workspace with me.

Go Live, by contrast, is a public community broadcast. When you want to share with your community, use Go Live. When you want personal, private AI assistance, use Start Stream. They live in different parts of the platform because they serve fundamentally different purposes.
