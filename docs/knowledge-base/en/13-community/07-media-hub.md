# Community Media Hub

Every community has a story. It is told not just through conversations and events, but through the images, videos, and shared moments that capture what it feels like to belong. The Media Hub is where that story lives -- a visual record of community life in Vitanaland.

Think of it as your community's photo album, except it is always growing, always accessible, and always shared with the people who were part of those moments.

## What You Will Find in the Media Hub

The Media Hub collects visual content from across the community in one browsable space. Here is what you will find:

**Photos from Events.** When members attend community events -- fitness sessions, social gatherings, wellness workshops, meetups -- they often capture photos that tell the story of what happened. These photos appear in the Media Hub, organized by event and date. They are a visual record of community life that grows richer over time.

**Videos and Clips.** Short video content shared by members -- highlights from events, personal updates, demonstrations of exercises or recipes, and snapshots of everyday wellness moments. Video brings energy and personality to the community in a way that text alone cannot.

**Live Room Highlights.** When highlights are captured during live room sessions, they flow into the Media Hub as well. These are saved segments from real-time conversations -- the best moments from knowledge-sharing sessions, group discussions, and community broadcasts. You can revisit them anytime, even if you were not present when they were recorded.

**Group Media.** Each group generates its own stream of visual content. The Media Hub lets you browse media by group, so you can see the visual story of the specific communities you belong to. It is a way to stay connected to the life of your groups, even on days when you cannot actively participate.

**Member-Shared Content.** Individual members can upload photos and videos directly to the Media Hub -- a sunrise from a morning walk, a meal they are proud of, a snapshot from a health milestone. These personal shares add a human, intimate dimension to the community's visual story.

## Browsing Media

The Media Hub is designed for easy, enjoyable browsing. You can explore content in several ways:

**Chronological Feed.** The default view shows the most recent media first, so you always see what is fresh. Scroll through to catch up on what the community has been sharing.

**By Group.** Filter to see media from a specific group. This is especially useful if you are part of several communities and want to focus on one at a time.

**By Event.** View all media associated with a particular event. This is perfect for reliving a workshop you attended or seeing what happened at an event you missed.

**By Type.** Filter for just photos, just videos, or just live room highlights, depending on what you are in the mood for.

**Search.** Looking for something specific? Search by keywords, event names, or group names to find the content you are looking for.

## Uploading Your Own Content

You are not just a viewer in the Media Hub. You are a contributor. Sharing your own photos and videos adds to the community's collective memory and helps others feel connected to you and your journey.

To upload content, look for the upload option within the Media Hub or within a specific group's media section. You can:

**Share a Photo.** Upload directly from your camera roll or take a new photo. Add a brief caption to give context -- where you were, what you were doing, why the moment mattered.

**Share a Video.** Upload a short video clip. This could be anything from a quick wellness tip to a beautiful scene from your morning walk to a clip of a group fitness session.

**Tag a Group or Event.** When uploading, you can associate your content with a specific group or event. This ensures it appears in the right context and is easy for the right people to find.

Keep your contributions authentic. The most valued content in the Media Hub is not polished or perfect -- it is real. A genuine photo of your morning meditation space, a candid video from a community meetup, a shot of the healthy meal you cooked tonight. These are the moments that make community feel human.

## Media from Live Rooms and Sessions

One of the richest sources of Media Hub content is live rooms. When someone captures a highlight during a live session, that moment is preserved and flows into the Media Hub. Over time, this creates a searchable library of the community's best live moments -- insights, breakthroughs, celebrations, and conversations worth revisiting.

If you host or participate in live rooms regularly, the Media Hub becomes a natural archive of your sessions. It is valuable not just for nostalgia but for reference. Did someone share a particularly useful tip during a live wellness discussion last month? Check the Media Hub. It is probably there.

## A Visual Record of Community Life

The Media Hub serves a deeper purpose than simple photo storage. It is a living document of what this community is and what it does. When a new member joins a group and browses the Media Hub, they do not just see images. They see the proof that this is an active, warm, real community where people show up, participate, and care about each other.

That visual evidence of belonging is powerful. It tells newcomers that they are joining something alive. And it reminds existing members of the journey they have been on together.

Communities with shared visual memories are stronger communities. The photos and videos in the Media Hub are the threads that weave individual experiences into a collective story. Your contributions to that story matter.

## Sharing Beyond the Hub

When you find a piece of content in the Media Hub that resonates with you -- a photo from an event you loved, a video that inspired you, a highlight from a live room that said something important -- you can share it. Share it within your groups, send it to a friend on the platform, or save it to your own collection for future reference.

Great content deserves to be seen. And sharing it strengthens the connections that make this community worth being part of.
