# Accepting and Dismissing Matches

Every match I show you is an invitation, not an obligation. You are always in control of which connections you pursue and which ones you pass on. The actions you take -- accepting, dismissing, or saving -- are simple and quick, but they carry real meaning. They help you build the right connections, and they teach me what matters to you so that every future match gets a little more accurate.

Let me walk you through how it all works.

## Accepting a Match

When you see a match that resonates, accepting it is the first step toward building a new connection. What happens next depends on the type of match.

**Person match.** Accepting sends a connection request to the other person. If they accept too, you are connected and can begin messaging each other. I include a brief note about what you have in common to help start the conversation naturally. You are never forced into an awkward cold introduction -- I provide context for both of you.

**Group match.** Accepting joins you to the group. You immediately gain access to the group's discussion space, event calendar, and member list. Most groups welcome new members warmly, and many have introduction threads where you can say hello and share a bit about yourself.

**Event match.** Accepting RSVPs you for the event. You will receive a reminder before it starts, and the event will appear on your schedule. For virtual events, you will get the link to join. For in-person events, you will get the location details.

**Service match.** Accepting takes you to the professional's profile where you can learn more about their credentials and availability, and book a consultation if you choose. Accepting a service match does not automatically commit you to anything -- it simply opens the door.

**Product match.** Accepting takes you to the product page where you can read more details, see reviews from the community, and add it to your cart if you decide to purchase.

**Location match.** Accepting saves the location to your favorites so you can find it easily later. You can also get directions, see hours, and check what other community members have said about the place.

**Live room match.** Accepting adds the session to your schedule and notifies you when it is about to begin. If the room is live right now, accepting takes you directly into the session.

In every case, accepting is a low-commitment first step. It opens a door. You decide how far to walk through it.

## Dismissing a Match

If a match does not feel right, dismissing it is just as simple. Tap dismiss, and the match is removed from your current view.

Dismissing is never penalized. I understand that not every match will resonate, and that is perfectly fine. You might dismiss a match because the timing is wrong, because the focus does not align with your current priorities, or simply because it does not feel like a fit. All of those are valid reasons, and I respect them.

What dismissing does do is inform my future suggestions. When you consistently dismiss certain types of matches, I learn from that pattern. If you rarely engage with product matches, I will reduce their frequency. If you dismiss matches from a certain geographic area, I adjust. Over time, your dismissals help me filter out what is not useful so that your match feed becomes increasingly relevant.

I never dismiss a match on your behalf. Every card stays until you act on it, save it, or a new day brings fresh suggestions.

## Saving for Later

Sometimes a match looks interesting but the timing is not right. Maybe you want to attend that event but need to check your schedule first. Maybe a person match looks promising but you want to think about it before reaching out. That is what "save for later" is for.

Saved matches are stored in your matchmaking section where you can revisit them anytime. They do not expire. If you save a person match today and come back to it next week, you can still accept and send a connection request. If you save an event match, you will still be able to RSVP as long as the event has not already happened.

Saving is a useful habit because it prevents good matches from slipping through the cracks on busy days. I recommend using it whenever something catches your eye but you are not ready to act immediately.

## How Your Choices Shape Future Matches

This is one of the most important things to understand about the matching system: your actions are the primary feedback loop that makes it smarter.

**Accepting teaches me what you want.** When you accept a person match with shared fitness goals, I learn that fitness alignment is important to you. When you accept a group focused on nutrition, I know that topic matters. When you consistently accept event matches in your local area, I prioritize geographic proximity in future suggestions.

**Dismissing teaches me what you do not want.** If you regularly dismiss professional service matches, I understand that you prefer self-directed progress right now. If you skip product suggestions, I reduce them. If you dismiss matches with low scores, I raise my threshold for what I show you.

**Deeper engagement reinforces patterns.** It is not just the initial accept or dismiss that matters. What happens after also teaches me. If you accept a person match and that connection leads to regular conversations, shared challenge participation, or attending the same events, I understand that the factors behind that match were strong. I look for more connections with similar alignment. If an accepted match leads to no further engagement, I note that too and adjust.

**Saving tells me about timing.** When you save matches rather than acting on them immediately, I learn that you are interested but selective. I may highlight similar options in the future while respecting that you prefer to take your time with new connections.

All of this happens quietly in the background. You do not need to configure anything or explain your preferences in words. Your actions speak clearly, and I listen carefully.

## A Note on Connection Quality

I want to encourage you to be intentional about the matches you accept. It is natural to accept everything, but the research on social bonds and longevity suggests that depth matters more than breadth. A few meaningful connections will do more for your health than dozens of shallow ones.

Take a moment to read the "why this match" explanation on each card. Consider whether this connection aligns with where you are in your journey. Trust your instincts. If a match does not feel right, there is no pressure to accept it. Tomorrow will bring new opportunities.

The goal is not to maximize connections. The goal is to build a small, strong, longevity-aligned network of people, communities, and resources that genuinely support the life you want to live.
