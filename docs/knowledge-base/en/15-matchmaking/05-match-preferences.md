# Match Preferences

While my matching system learns a great deal from your behavior -- the matches you accept, dismiss, and engage with -- you also have direct control over the types of connections I suggest. Your match preferences are a set of filters and settings that shape how I search for matches on your behalf. Think of them as guardrails: they tell me what to prioritize, what to include, and what to leave out.

Let me explain each preference and how it affects your experience.

## Match Types

You can choose which of the seven match types you want to see in your daily matches. By default, all types are active: person, group, event, service, product, location, and live room. But you might prefer to focus on certain types at different times.

If you are in a phase where building personal connections is your priority, you can emphasize person and group matches. If you are looking for professional guidance, you can turn up service matches. If you prefer to discover events and live rooms, you can weight those more heavily.

You can adjust these at any time, and I will respond immediately. Turning off a match type does not mean I will never surface it again -- it just means it will not appear in your daily feed until you turn it back on. I may still mention relevant opportunities through our conversations if something genuinely important comes up.

## Geographic Range

Geography matters for longevity connections, especially when it comes to in-person interaction. You can set a preferred geographic range that tells me how far to look when generating matches.

**Local.** If you want matches close to home -- people you could meet for a walk, events in your neighborhood, wellness centers nearby -- set a tight range. This is ideal if you value real-world connection and want to build a local longevity community.

**Regional.** A broader range captures opportunities within your wider area -- a city-level or state-level scope. This is useful if you live in a less densely populated area or if you are open to traveling a short distance for the right event or connection.

**Global.** If geography is not a factor for you -- if you are comfortable with virtual friendships, online group participation, and digital events -- you can open the range to include anyone in the Vitanaland community worldwide.

Your geographic preference applies primarily to person, group, event, location, and live room matches. Product and service matches may draw from a wider area when the service is delivered virtually or the product can be shipped.

## Health Focus Areas

This is one of the most impactful preferences you can set. Health focus areas tell me which of your health pillars or wellness topics should take priority in matching.

You can select from focus areas like nutrition, exercise, sleep, hydration, mental health, stress management, strength training, cardiovascular fitness, cognitive health, social connection, and more. When you activate a focus area, I give extra weight to matches that relate to that topic.

For example, if you set "sleep" as a health focus, you will see more matches related to sleep -- people who have improved their sleep quality, groups focused on recovery and rest, events about sleep science, professionals who specialize in sleep health, and products designed for better rest.

You can set multiple focus areas, and I will balance across them. I recommend updating your focus areas as your goals evolve. What matters most to you this month might shift next month, and your matches should shift with it.

## Age Range

For person matches, you can set a preferred age range. This is entirely optional. Some people prefer to connect with peers in a similar life stage. Others find value in intergenerational connections -- learning from someone older or mentoring someone younger.

If you set an age range, I will prioritize person matches within that range. If you leave it open, I will match based purely on longevity alignment without regard to age. In practice, the strongest matches often cross age boundaries because health goals and lifestyle values are not limited to any generation.

## Language

If you speak multiple languages or prefer to connect with people who share your primary language, you can set a language preference. This is especially useful in a global community where members communicate in many languages.

When a language preference is set, I prioritize matches where smooth communication is likely. For groups and events, I surface those conducted in your preferred language. For person matches, I look for shared language capability.

## How Preferences Shape the Algorithm

Your preferences do not replace the algorithm -- they shape it. The matching system still considers your Vitana Index, your health goals, your community activity, your lifestyle patterns, and your accept and dismiss history. Preferences add an additional layer of guidance on top of that intelligence.

Think of it this way: the algorithm finds the matches. Your preferences tell me which matches to bring to the front of the line.

If you set tight preferences -- a narrow age range, a small geographic area, a single health focus -- your daily matches will be fewer but more focused. If you keep preferences broad, you will see a wider variety of suggestions. Neither approach is better or worse. It depends on what kind of experience you are looking for right now.

## Updating Preferences Over Time

I encourage you to revisit your match preferences periodically. Your longevity journey is not static, and your matching experience should not be either.

Maybe six months ago you were focused on nutrition and wanted local connections. Now you have shifted your attention to mental health and you are open to global connections for the first time. Updating your preferences takes only a moment, and the impact on your daily matches is immediate.

You can access your match preferences from the Matchmaking section -- look for the settings or preferences option. Changes take effect starting with your next batch of daily matches.

## The ORB Learns Too

Beyond the explicit preferences you set, I also learn from your behavior. This is worth repeating because it is important: your accepts, dismisses, saves, and engagement patterns all refine the matching system in ways that go deeper than any single preference setting.

If you accept a person match who shares your interest in cold exposure, I do not need you to add "cold exposure" as a health focus. I already learned it from your action. If you consistently attend events on weekday evenings, I do not need you to set a time preference. I adjust naturally.

Your preferences and your behavior work together. The preferences set the boundaries. Your actions paint the picture within those boundaries. Over time, the two converge into a matching experience that feels like it genuinely understands you -- because it does.

## My Recommendation

If you are just getting started, I suggest keeping your preferences relatively open. Let the system learn from your behavior for the first few weeks. Accept the matches that feel right, dismiss the ones that do not, and let me calibrate to your natural patterns.

Once you have a sense of what resonates, tighten your preferences to sharpen the focus. Turn off match types you do not need right now. Narrow your geographic range if local connection is what you want. Set health focus areas that reflect your current priorities.

And remember -- you can always adjust. Your preferences are a living part of your Vitanaland experience, just like the rest of your longevity journey.
