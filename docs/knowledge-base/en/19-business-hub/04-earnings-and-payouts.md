# Earnings and Payouts

Your professional work has real economic value, and the Business Hub ensures you receive that value clearly, promptly, and transparently. Let me walk you through how earnings work, how payouts are processed, and how your professional income connects to the broader picture of financial longevity.

## How You Earn

As a professional in the Business Hub, your earnings come from the services you provide to the community. Every booking that is completed generates income for your practice.

### Service Revenue

When a client books and completes a session with you -- a consultation, coaching session, workshop, or program enrollment -- the fee they paid goes to you, minus a small platform fee.

The platform fee is transparent and consistent. It covers the infrastructure that makes the Business Hub possible: the booking system, the payment processing, the client matching, the communication tools, and the reputation system. The fee is clearly stated before you set your prices, so you can account for it when determining what to charge. There are no hidden deductions, no surprise fees, and no charges that appear after the fact.

The vast majority of what your clients pay goes directly to you. The Business Hub exists to support your practice, not to extract from it.

### Workshop and Program Revenue

Workshops and programs that carry enrollment fees generate revenue each time a participant enrolls. For group-based offerings, this means your earning potential scales with attendance. A workshop with twenty participants generates twenty times the enrollment fee, minus the platform fee.

Programs that span multiple weeks or sessions generate revenue at the time of enrollment. The full program fee is collected upfront and credited to your account, even though the sessions are delivered over time. This gives you financial predictability for your longer-term offerings.

### Recurring Client Revenue

Clients who book with you regularly create a steady, predictable income stream. Coaching relationships that span months, repeat consultation clients, and members enrolled in ongoing programs all contribute to a baseline of recurring revenue.

This is one of the most powerful aspects of the Business Hub for your financial health. Predictable income reduces financial stress. Financial stability supports your own wellbeing. And your personal wellbeing directly affects the quality of care you provide to your clients. The cycle is self-reinforcing.

## Your Earnings Dashboard

The Business Hub includes a dedicated earnings dashboard that gives you complete visibility into your financial activity.

### What You See

**Total earnings.** Your cumulative earnings across all services, all time. This number represents the full value your professional expertise has created within the community.

**Period earnings.** Your earnings for the current week, month, and quarter. These views help you understand your earning trajectory and plan your practice accordingly.

**Earnings by service.** A breakdown of which services generate the most revenue. This insight helps you understand where demand is strongest and where you might want to invest more of your time and energy.

**Pending earnings.** Amounts that have been earned but are still in the processing period before they become available for withdrawal. Pending earnings are always visible so you know exactly what is coming.

**Payout history.** A complete record of every payout you have received -- when it was processed, how much it was, and which payment method received it.

### Trends and Insights

Beyond the raw numbers, the earnings dashboard shows you trends. Is your revenue growing month over month? Are certain services gaining traction while others plateau? Is your client base expanding, or is the same group of clients driving most of your income?

These insights are not just financial data. They are signals about your practice. Growing revenue from coaching packages might tell you that your ongoing relationships are where you create the most value. Increasing workshop attendance might suggest that the community is hungry for the topic you are teaching. A plateau in consultations might prompt you to refresh your listing or adjust your approach.

I surface these insights to help you make informed decisions about your practice. My goal is not to push you toward maximum revenue -- it is to help you build a sustainable, fulfilling professional life that supports your own longevity while serving the community.

## How Payouts Work

When your available balance reaches the minimum payout threshold, you can request a withdrawal. Here is how the process works.

### Payout Methods

You can receive your earnings through the payout methods available in your region. Common options include:

- **Bank transfer.** Direct deposit to your bank account. This is the most common payout method and typically processes within a few business days.
- **Digital payment services.** Depending on your location, you may be able to receive payouts through popular digital payment platforms for faster access.

You configure your preferred payout method in your Business Hub settings. You can change it at any time, and the change takes effect on your next payout.

### Payout Schedule

Payouts are processed on a regular schedule. The specific timing depends on when you request the payout and the processing time for your chosen method. I keep you informed throughout the process -- when a payout is initiated, when it is processing, and when it has been completed.

If you prefer automatic payouts, you can configure the system to process a withdrawal whenever your available balance exceeds the threshold. This means your earnings flow to your bank account on a predictable cadence without you needing to initiate each one manually.

### The Processing Period

There is a brief processing period between when you earn revenue and when it becomes available for withdrawal. This period exists to ensure that the transaction is fully settled -- that the client's payment has cleared, that there are no disputes or adjustments, and that the amount credited to your account is accurate.

The processing period is clearly disclosed and consistent. You always know how long it takes for earned revenue to become available, and your pending earnings are visible in your dashboard throughout the process.

## Tax-Relevant Transaction History

Your earnings from the Business Hub may be subject to tax obligations depending on your jurisdiction. The platform maintains a complete, detailed transaction history that supports your tax reporting needs.

### What Is Recorded

Every transaction is logged with:

- Date and time of the transaction
- Service type and description
- Client identifier (for your records, not their personal details)
- Gross amount (what the client paid)
- Platform fee (the deduction for infrastructure support)
- Net amount (what you received)
- Payout date and method

### Exporting Records

You can export your transaction history at any time. The export includes all the detail you need for tax preparation, accounting, and financial planning. Whether you handle your taxes yourself or work with an accountant, the data is there in a clean, organized format.

I encourage you to review your transaction records regularly and consult with a tax professional about your obligations. The platform provides the data, but tax guidance is outside my scope -- and it is important enough to get right that professional advice is worth the investment.

## How Professional Earnings Support Financial Longevity

Here is the connection I want you to hold onto. Your professional earnings are not separate from your longevity journey. They are part of it.

Financial stability is a health factor. When your income is predictable, your stress is lower. When your stress is lower, your sleep improves, your inflammation decreases, your decision-making gets clearer, and your ability to invest in your own health strengthens. Every element of your wellbeing is downstream of the financial security that a sustainable practice provides.

The Business Hub is designed to support that sustainability. By connecting you with clients who genuinely need your expertise, by handling the administrative overhead so you can focus on your work, and by ensuring that your earnings are transparent, predictable, and fairly calculated, the platform removes many of the financial friction points that make independent professional practice so stressful.

Your purpose -- helping others live longer, healthier lives -- deserves to be financially sustainable. The Business Hub is built on that belief.
