# Creating Services

Your service listing is how the community discovers what you offer. A well-crafted listing does more than describe your service -- it communicates your expertise, your approach, and the specific ways you help people on their longevity journey. Let me walk you through the process of creating services that genuinely connect with the members who need them.

## Service Types

The Business Hub supports several types of service listings, each designed for different kinds of professional engagement.

### One-on-One Consultations

These are individual sessions between you and a client. They might be initial assessments, follow-up consultations, check-ins, or deep-dive sessions focused on a specific health concern. Consultations are the most personal form of service and often form the foundation of a long-term professional relationship.

When you create a consultation listing, you define the duration, the format (video call, phone, or in-person if applicable), the focus area, and the price. You can create multiple consultation types -- for example, a 30-minute check-in at one price and a 60-minute comprehensive session at another.

### Coaching Sessions

Coaching sessions are structured engagements designed to guide clients through behavior change, goal achievement, or skill development over time. Unlike a single consultation, coaching typically involves a series of sessions with clear progression.

You can list coaching as a package -- a defined number of sessions at a set price -- or as ongoing sessions that clients book individually. The choice depends on your coaching style and what serves your clients best.

### Programs

Programs are structured experiences with defined start and end dates, clear outcomes, and a planned progression. A four-week nutrition reset. An eight-week strength building program. A six-session stress management course. Programs allow you to deliver your expertise in a format that guides participants through a complete journey.

When you create a program listing, you define the duration, the number of sessions, what participants will cover, what outcomes they can expect, and the enrollment price. Programs can have limited capacity if you want to ensure a more intimate group experience, or they can be open to larger groups if the format supports it.

### Workshops

Workshops are one-time or short-series events focused on a specific topic. They are typically group-based and more educational in nature than coaching or consultations. A workshop on reading your blood work results. A masterclass on sleep hygiene. A group meditation session. A cooking demonstration focused on anti-inflammatory meals.

Workshops can be free -- to build your reputation and attract potential clients -- or they can carry a fee. Either way, they position you as a knowledgeable contributor to the community and give members a low-commitment way to experience your expertise before engaging in deeper services.

## Building Your Listing

Creating a compelling service listing is an important step. Here is how to approach each element.

### Title

Your title should be clear and specific. Members scrolling through available services should immediately understand what you offer. "60-Minute Nutrition Consultation" is better than "Health Session." "8-Week Strength for Longevity Program" is better than "Fitness Program." Specificity builds trust because it shows you know exactly what you are offering.

### Description

Your description is where you connect with potential clients on a deeper level. Here is what to include:

**What the service covers.** Be specific about what you address. If it is a nutrition consultation, explain whether you focus on meal planning, supplement guidance, metabolic health, food sensitivities, or a combination. If it is a coaching package, describe the progression from session to session.

**Who it is for.** Help potential clients self-select by describing who benefits most from your service. "Ideal for people over 40 who want to rebuild their fitness foundation" is more helpful than "suitable for everyone." Specificity helps the right people find you and ensures better outcomes.

**What they can expect.** Describe the experience. What happens during a session? What preparation is needed? What follow-up do they receive? Setting clear expectations reduces anxiety for new clients and builds confidence in your professionalism.

**How it supports longevity.** Connect your service to the broader longevity mission. This is not about marketing language -- it is about helping members understand why your specific expertise matters for their long-term health. If your coaching addresses chronic inflammation through lifestyle changes, say that. If your workshops teach stress management techniques that protect cardiovascular health, make that connection explicit.

### Credentials and Experience

Your listing includes a space for your professional background. This is where you share your qualifications, certifications, years of experience, and areas of specialization. Members want to know that the person they are booking has real expertise, and your credentials provide that assurance.

Be honest and specific. List the certifications you actually hold, the training you have completed, and the experience that qualifies you to offer this service. If you have published research, completed advanced training, or worked with specific populations, include that context. Credibility is built on truth, and the community will verify it over time through the outcomes you deliver.

### Pricing

Set your pricing based on the value you provide, the time involved, and what is sustainable for your practice. The Business Hub does not dictate your prices. You have full control over what you charge.

A few considerations as you set prices:

**Be transparent.** The listed price should be the actual price. No hidden fees, no surprise add-ons, no "starting at" prices that balloon once the session begins. Members should know exactly what they are paying when they book.

**Consider your market.** Look at what similar services cost within the ecosystem. You do not need to be the cheapest -- in fact, underpricing can signal low quality. But your pricing should reflect what you offer and what the community can sustain.

**Offer range.** If appropriate, offer services at different price points. A shorter introductory session at a lower price gives potential clients a way to experience your approach before committing to a longer engagement. This builds trust and often leads to higher-value bookings over time.

### Availability

Your availability settings determine when clients can book with you. Set your available hours, your timezone, and any blackout dates. The scheduling system handles the rest -- clients see your open slots, book the one that works for them, and both of you receive confirmation.

Keep your availability current. If your schedule changes, update it promptly. Nothing erodes trust faster than a client who books a session only to discover it needs to be rescheduled because the availability was outdated.

## How Services Appear in the Marketplace

Once your listing is live, it becomes discoverable within Vitanaland's Discover section and through my recommendations.

When a member's health data or expressed goals align with what you offer, I surface your service as a relevant option. This is not paid placement. It is relevance-based matching. If someone's sleep data has been declining and you offer a sleep optimization program, your listing gains visibility to that person because it addresses their current need.

Community feedback also influences visibility. Services with consistently positive outcomes and strong client feedback appear more prominently than services that are new or untested. This rewards quality over marketing and ensures that members are directed toward professionals who deliver real results.

## Quality Standards

The Business Hub maintains quality standards that every service must meet. These are not burdensome requirements -- they are common-sense guidelines that protect both you and your clients.

**Honest representation.** Your listing must accurately describe what you offer. No exaggerated claims about outcomes, no misleading credentials, and no promises that your service cannot deliver.

**Professional conduct.** Services must be delivered with professionalism, respect, and care. The community trusts the Business Hub to connect them with practitioners who take their responsibility seriously.

**Health pillar alignment.** Every service in the Business Hub must support at least one dimension of longevity -- physical health, mental wellbeing, social connection, lifestyle optimization, or preventive care. This ensures that the marketplace stays focused on its purpose: supporting people's long-term health.

**Responsiveness.** Clients who book your services deserve timely communication. Responding to booking requests, answering questions, and following up after sessions are all expected professional behaviors.

These standards are not about controlling your practice. They are about maintaining the trust that makes the Business Hub valuable for everyone -- practitioners and members alike.

## Evolving Your Offerings

Your services are not static. As your practice grows, your expertise deepens, and you learn what the community needs most, I encourage you to evolve your offerings.

Add new services when you identify gaps you can fill. Update existing listings when your approach improves. Adjust pricing as your reputation and demand grow. Retire services that no longer reflect your best work.

I help with this by sharing insights about community demand, feedback on your existing services, and suggestions for how to refine your listings. The goal is always to connect your professional expertise with the people who will benefit most -- and to do that effectively, your listings need to stay current and honest.
