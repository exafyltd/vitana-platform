# Managing Clients

Great professional relationships are built on consistency, trust, and genuine care. The Business Hub gives you tools to manage your client relationships in a way that reflects those values -- making it easier to stay organized, stay responsive, and stay focused on what matters most: helping people live longer, healthier lives.

## Your Client Dashboard

When you open the Business Hub, your client dashboard is where everything comes together. It shows you:

**Upcoming sessions.** Your next scheduled sessions, with client names, session types, and timing. You can see at a glance what your day and week look like, so you can prepare for each interaction.

**Recent activity.** A feed of recent bookings, completed sessions, client messages, and feedback. This keeps you current on what is happening in your practice without needing to dig through separate screens.

**Client list.** A complete view of everyone who has engaged with your services. You can search, sort, and filter by various criteria -- frequency of engagement, service type, how long they have been your client, and more.

**Pending actions.** Anything that needs your attention -- a booking request waiting for confirmation, a message from a client, feedback to review -- is surfaced clearly so nothing slips through the cracks.

The dashboard is designed to minimize administrative overhead so you can spend your energy on the work that matters -- your actual client interactions.

## Viewing and Managing Bookings

When a client books one of your services, the booking appears in your schedule with all relevant details:

- **Client name and profile.** You can see who booked, their longevity focus areas, and any relevant health context they have chosen to share. This helps you prepare for the session with a baseline understanding of where they are.
- **Service type.** Which of your listings they booked, so you know what they are expecting.
- **Date, time, and format.** When the session is scheduled and whether it is a video call, phone call, or other format.
- **Special notes.** If the client included any notes when booking -- questions they want to address, concerns they want to discuss -- those appear with the booking.

### Confirming and Adjusting

Most bookings are confirmed automatically based on your availability settings. If a booking requires manual confirmation, you receive a notification and can accept or suggest an alternative time.

If you need to reschedule a session, the system makes it easy to propose new times. The client receives the proposed change and can accept or suggest their own alternative. The goal is minimal friction for both parties.

Cancellations happen. When they do, the system handles the logistics -- notifying the client, processing any refund or credit adjustment, and freeing the time slot. I encourage you to communicate personally when you need to cancel, because a brief message explaining why goes a long way in maintaining trust.

## Client Communication

Communication with your clients happens through the platform's messaging system, keeping all professional conversations in one place.

### Before Sessions

Many clients appreciate a brief message before their first session. A welcome note, a reminder of what to prepare, or a simple acknowledgment that you are looking forward to the session sets a positive tone. You can create message templates for common pre-session communications to save time while maintaining a personal touch.

### After Sessions

Post-session follow-up is one of the most impactful things you can do for client retention and outcomes. A brief message summarizing what you discussed, any action items for the client, and what to expect in the next session demonstrates professionalism and care.

The Business Hub lets you send follow-up messages directly from the session record, so your post-session communication is connected to the specific interaction. This keeps everything organized and makes it easy to reference later.

### Ongoing Communication

Between sessions, clients may have questions, updates, or concerns. The messaging system lets you handle these efficiently. You can set expectations about your response time -- clients understand that you have other commitments, and clarity about when they can expect a reply prevents frustration on both sides.

## Session Notes and Records

Good record-keeping supports good practice. The Business Hub includes a notes system designed for professional use.

### Session Notes

After each session, you can record notes about what was covered, what was observed, what recommendations were made, and what the client committed to. These notes are private to you -- the client does not see them unless you choose to share specific information.

Session notes serve several purposes:

- **Continuity.** When your client returns for their next session, your notes help you pick up exactly where you left off. This is especially important for coaching relationships and multi-session programs where progress builds over time.
- **Pattern recognition.** Over multiple sessions, your notes reveal patterns -- recurring challenges, areas of consistent progress, topics the client returns to. These patterns inform your approach and help you provide more targeted guidance.
- **Professional integrity.** Maintaining clear records of what you discussed and recommended protects both you and your client. If there is ever a question about what was advised, your notes provide the reference.

### Client Records

Beyond individual session notes, the Business Hub maintains a client record that aggregates your entire history with each client. You can see:

- How many sessions you have had together
- What services they have engaged with
- Your notes across all interactions
- Feedback they have provided
- The trajectory of your professional relationship over time

This longitudinal view helps you understand each client as a complete person on a health journey, not just a series of isolated appointments.

## Building Long-Term Professional Relationships

The most valuable thing you can build in the Business Hub is not a large client roster. It is a collection of deep, sustained professional relationships that genuinely support people's longevity.

Here is why this matters. Longevity is not built in a single session. It is built over years of consistent, guided effort. The professionals who make the biggest difference in someone's life are not the ones who provide a brilliant one-time insight -- they are the ones who show up session after session, adapting their guidance as the client's needs evolve, celebrating progress, and helping navigate setbacks.

The Business Hub is designed to support exactly this kind of long-term engagement:

**Client retention tools.** You can see which clients have not booked in a while and reach out proactively. Sometimes a gentle check-in is all it takes to re-engage someone who drifted away not because they lost interest, but because life got busy.

**Progress tracking.** Over time, you accumulate a picture of each client's trajectory. When you can show a client how far they have come since your first session together, that perspective is powerful -- both for their motivation and for your professional satisfaction.

**Relationship milestones.** The system recognizes long-term professional relationships. A client who has been working with you for six months or a year represents a meaningful commitment, and that is acknowledged.

**Trust building.** Every session you deliver well, every follow-up you send, every time you demonstrate that you remember and care about the details of someone's health journey -- these moments compound into a trust relationship that no marketing budget can buy.

## Scheduling Best Practices

A few suggestions from my observations of successful practitioners within the community:

**Buffer time.** Leave space between sessions. Back-to-back bookings lead to rushed endings, delayed starts, and diminished quality. A fifteen-minute buffer gives you time to record notes, prepare for the next client, and reset mentally.

**Consistent availability.** Clients prefer predictable schedules. If you are available on certain days and times consistently, it is easier for clients to build you into their routine. Sporadic availability creates friction in booking and can erode the consistency that both you and your clients need.

**Batch similar services.** If you offer different types of services, consider grouping similar ones on the same days. Coaching sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Workshops on Saturdays. Consultations on Wednesdays. This helps you maintain mental focus and reduces the cognitive switching that comes from rapid-fire transitions between different service types.

**Honor your limits.** You cannot serve others effectively if you are depleted yourself. Set your availability to reflect a sustainable workload, not an aspirational one. Your own longevity matters too, and chronic overwork undermines it.
